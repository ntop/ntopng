/** @class GenericHashEntry
 *  @brief Base hash entry class.
 *  @details Defined the base hash entry class for ntopng.
 *
 *  This class handle entries placed in hash tables built
 *  with class GenericHash.
 *
 *  GenericHashEntry has a lifecycle which is written into
 *  the enum HashEntryState and is implemented as a finite states
 *  machine. States are:
 *
 *  - hash_entry_state_active. This state is the default one which
 *  is set as soon as the GenericHashEntry is instantiated.
 *
 *  - hash_entry_state_idle. This state is set by method purgeIdle
 *  in class GenericHash and is used to explicitly mark the entry 
 *  as idle. NOTE that purgeIdle is always called inline, that is,
 *  in the thread which receives the incoming packets (or incoming
 *  flows). Once the entry has been marked as hash_entry_state_idle,
 *  the inline thread will not be able to fetch the entry again. Howevever,
 *  before deleting the entry, an extra transition is needed to make sure
 *  also a non-inline periodic thread has seen the entry.
 *
 *  - hash_entry_state_ready_to_be_purged. This state is set by
 *  non-inline periodic threads, generally from method updateStats,
 *  only after the inline thread has set state hash_entry_state_idle. This
 *  guarantees that also a non-inline thread has seen the entry before
 *  cleaning it up and freeing its memory. Once this state has been set,
 *  the inline-thread will perform the actual delete to free the memory.
 *
 *  The following diagram recaps the states transitions
 *
