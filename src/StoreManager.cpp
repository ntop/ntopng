 * @brief Executes a database query on an already opened SQLite3 DB

 * @param callback Callback to be executed by the DB in case the query
 *                 execution is successful.
 * @param payload A pointer to be passed to the callback in case it
 *                is actually executed.
 *
 * @return Zero in case of success, nonzero in case of failure.
