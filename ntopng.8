.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ntopng
shows the current network usage. It displays a list of hosts that are
currently using the network and reports information concerning the (IP and non-IP)
traffic generated and received by each host.
.B ntopng
may operate as a front-end collector or as a stand-alone collector/display program.
A web browser is needed to access the information captured by the
.B ntopng
program.

.B ntopng
is a hybrid layer 2 / layer 3 network monitor, by default it uses the layer 2 Media
Access Control (MAC) addresses AND the layer 3 tcp/ip addresses.
.B ntopng
is capable of associating the two, so that ip and non-ip traffic (e.g. arp, rarp) are combined
for a complete picture of network activity.

.PP
.SH OPTIONS

.It filename
The text of
.B filename
is copied \(em ignoring line breaks and comment lines (anything following a #) \(em into the
command line.
.B ntopng
behaves as if all of the text had simply been typed directly on the command line.
For example, if the command line is "ntopng s.conf" and file s.conf contains
just the line '\-s', then the effective command line is "ntopng \-s".
In case you use a configuration file, the following options on the command line
will be ignored. Example "ntopng /etc/ntopng/ntopng.conf \-v" the \-v option is ignored.

The configuration file is similar to the command line, with the exception that an equal
sign '=' must be used between key and value. Example:
\-i=p1p2
or
\-\-interface=p1p2
For options with no value (e.g. \-v) the equal is also necessary. Example: "\-v=" must be used.

Remember, most
.B ntopng
options are "sticky", that is they just set an internal flag. Invoking
them multiple times doesn't change the
.B ntopng's
behavior. However, options that set a value, such as \-\-trace\-level, will use the LAST value
given: \-w 8000 \-w 8080 will run as \-w 8080.

.It \-n|\-\-dns\-mode\ <mode>
Sets the DNS address resolution mode:
.br
0 \(em Decode DNS responses and resolve only local (\-m) numeric IPs
.br
1 \(em Decode DNS responses and resolve all numeric IPs
.br
2 \(em Decode DNS responses and don't resolve numeric IPs
.br
3 \(em Don't decode DNS responses and don't resolve numeric IPs

.It \-i|\-\-interface\ <interface|pcap>
Specifies the network interface or collector endpoint to be used by
.B ntopng
for network monitoring. On Unix you can specify both the interface name (e.g. lo)
or the numeric interface id as shown by ntopng \-h. On Windows you must use
the interface number instead. Note that you can specify \-i multiple times in order
to instruct
.B ntopng
to create multiple interfaces. If you want to pipe data from stdin use - (dash) as
device name. Example "cat ~/traffic.pcap | ./ntopng -i -".

The \-i option can also be used to specify a unified view of more interfaces,
given they are provided in a comma-separated list and with the "view:" prefix
(e.g. \-i view:eth0,eth1). This is just a logical view of multiple physical interfaces.

If a collector endpoint is specified,
.B ntopng
open a ZeroMQ connection to the specified endpoint as a subscriber whose format
is  <ZMQ endpoint>. Example of valid collector endpoints are "tcp://127.0.0.1:5556" or ipc://flows.ipc
Note that you can specify multiple endpoint, commas separated list, in order
to instruct
.B ntopng
to aggregate it in a single interface. (e.g \-i tcp://127.0.0.1:5556,ipc://flows.ipc)

If you want you can pass a path of a pcap file (e.g. \-i dummy.pcap) or a path of a list file contains a path of a pcap file for each line (e.g. \-i pcap.list) and ntopng will read packets from the specified pcap file/s.

.B nProbe
can be instructed to act as a publisher delivering flows to a ZeroMQ endpoint using the \-\-ZMQ <endpoint> parameter.

.It \-d|\-\-data\-dir\ <path>
Specifies the data directory (it must be writable). Default directory is /var/tmp/ntopng

.It \-d|\-\-install\-dir\ <path>
Specifies the installation directory. Default directory is retrieved from common install paths.

.It \-G|\-\-pid\-path\ <path>
Specifies the path where the PID (process ID) is saved. Default is /var/tmp/ntopng.pid

.It \-H|\-\-disable\-alerts
Disable the generation of alerts.

.It \-k|\-\-httpbl\-key\ <key>
Set the key used to access httpbl services (default: disabled).  Please read README.httpbl for more info.

.It \-c|\-\-categorization\-key\ <key>
Sets the key used to access host categorization services.
.B ntopng
categorizes hosts using services provided by Google.
In order to use these categorization services you need sign uo at 
https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/key_signup and use the
generated key with this command line option.

.It \-e|\-\-daemon
This parameter causes ntop to become a daemon, i.e. a task which runs in the background without connection to a specific terminal. To use ntop other than as a casual monitoring tool, you probably will want to use this option.

.It \-1|\-\-httpdocs\-dir\ <path>
Directory where HTTP documents are placed. Default: httpdocs.

.It \-2|\-\-scripts\-dir\ <path>
Directory where lua scripts reside. Default: scripts.

.It \-3|\-\-callbacks\-dir\ <path>
Directory where callback scripts reside. Default: scripts/callbacks.

.It \-w|\-\-http\-port\ <[:]http_port>
Sets the HTTP port of the embedded web server. If set to 0, the http server will be disabled. If you prepend a : before the port (i.e. -w :80) ntopng will listen to the loopback address.
NOTE: omitting the -w option won't disable http: ntopng will fallback to the default http port.

.It \-W|\-\-https\-port\ <[:]https_port>
Sets the HTTPS port of the embedded web server. If not set, it will be set to the value of \-w plus one. If you prepend a : before the port (i.e. -w :80) ntopng will listen to the loopback address.

.It \-m|\-\-local\-networks\ <local_nets>
.B ntopng
determines the ip addresses and netmasks for each active interface. Any traffic on
those networks is considered local. This parameter allows the user to define additional
networks and subnetworks whose traffic is also considered local in
.B ntopng
reports. All other hosts are considered remote. If not specified the default is
set to 192.168.1.0/24.

Commas separate multiple network values.
Both netmask and CIDR notation may be used, even mixed together, for instance
"131.114.21.0/24,10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0".

.It \-u|\-\-no\-promisc
Disable promiscous mode when capturing from network interfaces (by default promiscuous mode is used).

.It \-p|\-\-ndpi\-protocols\ <file>.protos
This parameter is used to specify a nDPI protocol file.
The format is <tcp|udp>:<port>,<tcp|udp>:<port>,.....@<proto> where
<port> is a port number and <proto> is a name of a protocol supported by nDPI protocol,
or host:"<string>"@<proto> where string is part of an host name.
As example see https://svn.ntop.org/svn/ntop/trunk/nDPI/example/protos.txt

.It \-P|\-\-disable\-host\-persistency
Disable host persistency in the Redis cache.

.It \-q|\-\-disable\-autologout
Disable web interface logout for inactivity.

.It \-l|\-\-disable\-login <mode>
Disable user login. Mode can be set to 0 (disable login only for localhost) or 1 (disable login only for all hosts). This is useful for debug purposes, local host access unrestricted, or if you want to let everyone access the web gui.
NOTE: this option lets anyone accessing the web interface (from localhost or from all hosts depending on the
parameter) be administrator of the web interface.

.It \-r|\-\-redis\ <redis_host[:port][@db id]>
Specifies the redis database host, port, and a database id. In case you plan to run multiple redis-based
applications on the same redis server, you need to use a different database id per application.
For more information about redis, please refer to http://redis.io/.

.It \-g|\-\-core\-affinity\ <cpu_core_id1[,cpu_core_id2,...]>
Bind the capture/processing threads to specific CPU cores, indicated in a comma-separated list. Cores are
assigned to interface processing loops in the order interfaces are mapped to IDs.
NOTE: ntopng automatically sets affinity of capture/processing threads to different CPU cores.

.It \-U|\-\-user\ <user>
Run ntopng with the specified system user instead of 'nobody'.

.It \-s|\-\-dont\-change\-user
Do not change user (debug only).

.It \-B|\-\-packet\-filter\ <filter>
Specifies the packet filter for the specified interface. For pcap/PF_RING interfaces
the filter has to be specified in BPF format (Berkeley Packet Filter).

.It \-X|\-\-max\-num\-flows\ <num>
Specify the maximum number of active flows that ntopng will handle. If more flows are
detected they will be discarded.

.It \-x|\-\-max\-num\-hosts\ <num>
Specify the maximum number of active hosts that ntopng will handle. If more hosts are
detected they will be discarded.

.It \-F|\-\-dump\-flows\ <mode>
If ntopng is compiled with sqlite support, flows can dumped persistently on disk using this option. The mode can be set to 
es - Dump on ntopng.es queue in Elasticsearch format that be insert on a ES database. In this case the format is "es;<idx type>;<idx name>;<es URL>;<http auth>". Example: -F "es;ntopng;ntopng-%Y.%m.%d;http://localhost:9200/_bulk;user:pwd". The <idx name> accepts the strftime() format.
mysql - Dump flows in MySQL tables. In this case the format is "<host[@port]|unix socket>:<dbname>:<table>:<user>:<pw>". Example -F "mysql;localhost;ntopng;flows-%Y.%m.%d;root;".

.It \-D|\-\-dump\-hosts\ <mode>
If ntopng is compiled with sqlite support, hosts contacts can dumped persistently on disk using this option.
Databases are created daily under <data directory>/<interface>/contacts. This options supports three dump
modes: local (dumps only local hosts), remote (dumps only remote hosts), all (dumps all hosts). If not
specified, no hosts are dumped to disk.

.It \-I|\-\-export\-flows\ <endpoint>
Export the expired flows on the specified endpoint. For instance supposing to start ntopng on host
1.2.3.4 as ntopng \-I "tcp://*:3456", it exports flows on this endpoint so that you can create a
hierarchy of ntopng's. You can achieve that by starting a collector ntopng as
ntopng \-i tcp://1.2.3.4:3456

.It \-O|\-\-communities\-list\ <filename>
Parse the specified file and retrieve a list of communities, that are a logical representation of
clusters of hosts that fall under the same administrative domain. The file must be in the following
format:
    communityX@id1=net1,net2,net3
    communityY@id2=net4,net5,net6
    ...

.It \-E|\-\-dump\-aggregations\ <mode>
If ntopng is compiled with sqlite support, hosts contacts can dumped persistently on disk using this option.
Databases are created daily under <data directory>/<interface>/contacts. This options supports three dump
modes: local (dumps only aggregations contacted by local hosts), remote (dumps only aggregations contacted by
remote hosts), all (dumps all aggregations). If not specified, no hosts are dumped to disk.

.It \-S|\-\-sticky\-hosts\ <mode>
ntopng periodically purges idle hosts. With this option you can modify this behaviour by telling ntopng
not to purge the hosts specified by \-S. This parameter requires an argument that can be "all" (Keep all hosts in memory),
"local" (Keep only local hosts), "remote" (Keep only remote hosts), "none" (Flush hosts when idle).

.It \-\-hw\-timestamp\-mode\ <mode>
Enable hw timestamping/stripping. Supported TS modes are:
.br
ixia \(em Timestamped packets by ixiacom.com hardware devices.

.It \-t|\-\-install-dir\ <dir>
Force ntopng to use the HTML/lua files installed on the specified directory. This option should not be used unless under testing or development, as packaging systems should place the files at the right place.

.It \-T|\-\-enable-taps\ <mode>
Enable tap interfaces to dump packets on. If not specified, traffic can bedumped only on disk but not sent live to apps.

.It \-Z|\-\-http\-prefix\ <prefix>
HTTP prefix to be prepended to URLs. This is useful when using ntopng behind a proxy.
E.g. if you want to make the ntopng web interface accessible through a proxy
at a certain IP address with the /ntopng/ base URL and you have the following
lines in your proxy's configuration:
    ProxyPass /ntopng/ http://192.168.0.3:3000/ntopng/
    ProxyPassReverse /ntopng/ http://192.168.0.3:3000/ntopng/
.br
you must use ntopng with \-Z "/ntopng/"

.It \-\-shutdown\-when\-done
Terminate ntopng when the input pcap file is over (debug only).

.It \-v|\-\-verbose
Verbose tracing.

.It \-V|\-\-version
Print
.B ntopng
version and quit.

.It \-h|\-\-help
Help

.SH "WEB VIEWS"
While
.B ntopng
is running, multiple users can access the traffic information using their web browsers.
.B ntopng
makes use of JavaScript and LESS CSS.

We do not expect problems with any current web browser, but our ability to test with less
common ones is very limited.  Testing has included Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer,
with very limited testing on other current common browsers such as Opera.

.SH NOTES
.B ntopng
requires a number of external tools and libraries to operate.
Certain other tools are optional, but add to the program's capabilities.

Required libraries include:

.B libpcap
from http://www.tcpdump.org/, version 1.0 or newer.

The Windows version makes use of
.B WinPcap
(libpcap for Windows) which may be downloaded from
http://winpcap.polito.it/install/default.htm.
.

.B ntopng
requires a POSIX threads library.
.

The
.B rrdtool
library creates 'Round-Robin databases' which are used to store historical data
in a format that permits long duration retention without growing larger over time.
