Query Definitions
-----------------

Place in this directory query definitions in JSON format
used by the Historical Flow Explorer, Analysis Page.

Built-in examples are provided and can be used as starting
point for building new queries. Please note that:

- The baseline is the same as for the Querie presets used by the 
  table page.

- The "chart" is an array of charts, each element is a different chart

- There is no limit to the number of charts, the only limit is that no
  more then 12 charts can be displayed per row; the row length is 12
  and you can specify the chart len using the "chart_width" (must be an
  integer between 1 and 12)

Examples
--------

Chart example:

    {
        "chart_id" : "top_dst_asn",              // Chart ID, each ID in the same page must be different
        
        "chart_i18n_name" : "top_dst_asn",       // Chart Name, displayed in the GUI, please add the name into the file scripts/locales/en.lua

        "chart_css_styles" : {                   // CSS chart styles, personalize your graphs, optional feature
            "max-height" : "25rem",
            "min-height" : "25rem",
        },
        
        "chart_endpoint" : "/lua/rest/v2/get/db/charts/example_asn_pie.lua",    // Chart endpoint
        
        "chart_events" : {                        // JS Events, optional feature
            "dataPointSelection" : "db_analyze"  
        },
        
        "chart_gui_filter" : "srv_asn",           // Filter displayed in the GUI on click if "dataPointSelection" is "db_analyze", if a special on click is needed, please
                                                  // check widget.js file and add a new array element, like for db_analyze
        
        "chart_sql_query" : "SELECT DST_ASN,SUM(TOTAL_BYTES) AS bytes FROM flows WHERE ($WHERE$) GROUP BY DST_ASN ORDER BY bytes DESC LIMIT 10",     // SQL query

        "chart_type" : "donut_apex_chart",        // Chart type, currently supported Apex Charts

        "chart_record_value" : "bytes",           // Value of the record given to the chart to be shown, from the endpoint if the default function is used

        "chart_record_label" : "DST_ASN",         // Label(name) of the record given to the chart to be shown, from the endpoint if the default function is used

        "chart_width" : 6,                        // Chart width, it can be a number between 1 and 12, optional feature
        
        "chart_y_formatter" : "format_bytes",     // JS tooltip event, optional feature
    }

SQL example:
    
    "chart_sql_query" : "SELECT histogram(5)(PACKETS+1) FROM (SELECT PACKETS FROM flows WHERE $WHERE$)",
