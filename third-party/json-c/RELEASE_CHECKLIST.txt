# Release checklist:

## Pre-release tasks

* Figure out whether a release is worthwhile to do.
* Analyze the previous release branch to see if anything should have been
  applied to master.
* Collect changes and assemble tentative release notes.
    * Identify previous release branch point
    * Check commit logs between previous branch point and now for
       notable changes worth mentioning
    * Create a new issues_closed_for_X.Y.md file
        * Include notable entries from here in the release notes.
    * Analyze APIs between previous release branch and master to produce list of
      changes (added/removed/updated funcs, etc...), and detect backwards compat
      issues.
        * https://github.com/lvc/abi-compliance-checker
        * If the new release is not backwards compatible, then this is a MAJOR release.
        * Mention removed features in ChangeLog
    * Update the AUTHORS file
    * Exclude mentioning changes that have already been included in a point 
      release of the previous release branch.

* Update ChangeLog with relevant notes before branching.

* Check that the compile works on Linux - automatic through Travis
* Check that the compile works on NetBSD
* Check that the compile works on Windows - automatic through AppVeyor

## Release creation

Start creating the new release:
    release=0.15
    git clone https://github.com/json-c/json-c json-c-${release}

    mkdir distcheck
    cd distcheck
    # Note, the build directory *must* be entirely separate from
    # the source tree for distcheck to work properly.
    cmake ../json-c-${release}
    make distcheck
    cd ..

Make any fixes/changes *before* branching.

    cd json-c-${release}
    git branch json-c-${release}
    git checkout json-c-${release}

------------

Using ${release}:
	Update the version in json_c_version.h
	Update the version in Doxyfile (PROJECT_NUMBER)
	Update the version in CMakeLists.txt (VERSION in the project(...) line)
	Update the version in config.h.win32 (several places)

Update the set_target_properties() line in CmakeLists.txt to set the shared
library version.  Generally, unless we're doing a major release, change:
	VERSION x.y.z
to
	VERSION x.y+1.z

    git commit -a -m "Bump version to ${release}"

------------

Generate the doxygen documentation:

    doxygen
    git add -f doc
    git commit doc

------------

Create the release tarballs:

    cd ..
    echo .git > excludes
    tar -czf json-c-${release}.tar.gz -X excludes json-c-${release}

    echo doc >> excludes
    tar -czf json-c-${release}-nodoc.tar.gz -X excludes json-c-${release}

------------

Tag the branch:

    cd json-c-${release}
    git tag -a json-c-${release}-$(date +%Y%m%d) -m "Release json-c-${release}"

    git push origin json-c-${release}
    git push --tags

------------

Go to Amazon S3 service at:
    https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/

Upload the two tarballs in the json-c_releases folder.
	When uploading, use "Standard" storage class, and make the uploaded files publicly accessible.

Logout of Amazon S3, and verify that the files are visible.
    https://s3.amazonaws.com/json-c_releases/releases/index.html

===================================

Post-release checklist:

    git checkout master

Add new section to ChangeLog for ${release}+1

Use ${release}.99 to indicate a version "newer" than anything on the branch:
	Update the version in json_c_version.h
	Update the version in Doxyfile
	Update the version in CMakeLists.txt
	Update the version in config.h.win32

Update RELEASE_CHECKLIST.txt, set release=${release}+1

Update the set_target_properties() line in CmakeLists.txt to match the release branch.

    git commit -a -m "Update the master branch to version 0.${release}.99"
    git push

------------

Update the gh-pages branch with new docs:

    cd json-c-${release}
    git checkout json-c-${release}
    cd ..

    git clone -b gh-pages https://github.com/json-c/json-c json-c-pages
    cd json-c-pages
    mkdir json-c-${release}
    cp -R ../json-c-${release}/doc json-c-${release}/.
    git add json-c-${release}
    git commit -a -m "Add the ${release} docs."

    vi index.html
    # Add/change links to current release.

    git commit -a -m "Update the doc links to point at ${release}"

    git push

------------

Update checksums on wiki page.

    cd ..
    openssl sha -sha256 json-c*gz
    openssl md5 json-c*gz

Copy and paste this output into the wiki page at:
	https://github.com/json-c/json-c/wiki

------------

Send an email to the mailing list.
