 * This product includes software developed by the University of Michigan,
 * Merit Network, Inc., and their contributors.
 *
 * This file had been called "radix.h" in the MRT sources.
 *
 * I renamed it to "patricia.h" since it's not an implementation of a general
 * radix trie.  Also, pulled in various requirements from "mrt.h" and added
 * some other things it could be used as a standalone API.

MRT Credits

    The Multi-Threaded Routing Toolkit
     _________________________________________________________________

   MRT was developed by [1]Merit Network, Inc., under National Science
   Foundation grant NCR-9318902, "Experimentation with Routing Technology
   to be Used for Inter-Domain Routing in the Internet."

    Current MRT Staff

    * [2]Craig Labovitz <labovit@merit.edu>
    * [3]Makaki Hirabaru <masaki@merit.edu>
    * [4]Farnam Jahanian <farnam@eecs.umich.edu>
    * Susan Hares <skh@merit.edu>
    * Susan R. Harris <srh@merit.edu>
    * Nathan Binkert <binkertn@eecs.umich.edu>
    * Gerald Winters <gerald@merit.edu>

    Project Alumni

    * [5]Marc Unangst <mju@merit.edu>
    * John Scudder <jgs@ieng.com>

   The BGP4+ extension was originally written by Francis Dupont
   <Francis.Dupont@inria.fr>.

   The public domain Struct C-library of linked list, hash table and
   memory allocation routines was developed by Jonathan Dekock
   <dekock@cadence.com>.

   Susan Rebecca Harris <srh@merit.edu> provided help with the
   documentation.
   David Ward <dward@netstar.com> provided bug fixes and helpful
   suggestions.
   Some sections of code and architecture ideas were taken from the GateD
   routing daemon.

   The first port to Linux with IPv6 was done by Pedro Roque
   <roque@di.fc.ul.pt>. Some interface routines to the Linux kernel were
   originally written by him.

   Alexey Kuznetsov made enhancements to 1.4.3a and fixed the Linux
   kernel intarface. Linux's netlink interface was written, referring to
   his code "iproute2".

   We would also like to thank our other colleagues in Japan, Portugal,
   the Netherlands, the UK, and the US for their many contributions to
   the MRT development effort.
