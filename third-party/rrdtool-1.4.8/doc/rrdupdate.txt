       The uuppddaattee function feeds new data values into an RRRRDD. The data is time
       aligned (interpolated) according to the properties of the RRRRDD to which
       the data is written.

       uuppddaatteevv This alternate version of uuppddaattee takes the same arguments and
               performs the same function. The _v stands for _v_e_r_b_o_s_e, which
               describes the output returned. uuppddaatteevv returns a list of any
               and all consolidated data points (CDPs) written to disk as a
               result of the invocation of update. The values are indexed by
               timestamp (time_t), RRA (consolidation function and PDPs per
               CDP), and data source (name).  Note that depending on the
               arguments of the current and previous call to update, the list
               may have no entries or a large number of entries.

               Since uuppddaatteevv requires direct disk access, the ----ddaaeemmoonn option
               cannot be used with this command.

       _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
               The name of the RRRRDD you want to update.

       ----tteemmppllaattee|--tt _d_s_-_n_a_m_e[::_d_s_-_n_a_m_e]...
               By default, the uuppddaattee function expects its data input in the
               order the data sources are defined in the RRD, excluding any
               COMPUTE data sources (i.e. if the third data source DDSSTT is
               COMPUTE, the third input value will be mapped to the fourth
               data source in the RRRRDD and so on). This is not very error
               resistant, as you might be sending the wrong data into an RRD.

               The template switch allows you to specify which data sources
               you are going to update and in which order. If the data sources
               specified in the template are not available in the RRD file,
               the update process will abort with an error message.

               While it appears possible with the template switch to update
               data sources asynchronously, RRRRDDttooooll implicitly assigns non-
               COMPUTE data sources missing from the template the _*_U_N_K_N_O_W_N_*
               value.

               Do not specify a value for a COMPUTE DDSSTT in the uuppddaattee
               function. If this is done accidentally (and this can only be
               done using the template switch), RRRRDDttooooll will ignore the value
               specified for the COMPUTE DDSSTT.

       ----ddaaeemmoonn _a_d_d_r_e_s_s
               If given, RRRRDDTTooooll will try to connect to the caching daemon
               rrdcached at _a_d_d_r_e_s_s and will fail if the connection cannot be
               established. If the connection is successfully established the
               values will be sent to the daemon instead of accessing the
               files directly.

               For a list of accepted formats, see the --ll option in the
               rrdcached manual.

       NN|_t_i_m_e_s_t_a_m_p::_v_a_l_u_e[::_v_a_l_u_e...]
               The data used for updating the RRD was acquired at a certain
               time. This time can either be defined in seconds since
               1970-01-01 or by using the letter 'N', in which case the update
               time is set to be the current time. Negative time values are
               subtracted from the current time. An AT_STYLE TIME
               SPECIFICATION (see the _r_r_d_f_e_t_c_h documentation) may also be used
               by delimiting the end of the time specification with the '@'
               character instead of a ':'. Getting the timing right to the
               second is especially important when you are working with data-
               sources of type CCOOUUNNTTEERR, DDEERRIIVVEE or AABBSSOOLLUUTTEE.

               When using negative time values, options and data have to be
               separated by two dashes (----), else the time value would be
               parsed as an option.  See below for an example.

               When using negative time values, options and data have to be
               separated by two dashes (----), else the time value would be
               parsed as an option.  See below for an example.

               The remaining elements of the argument are DS updates. The
               order of this list is the same as the order the data sources
               were defined in the RRA. If there is no data for a certain
               data-source, the letter UU (e.g., N:0.1:U:1) can be specified.

               The format of the value acquired from the data source is
               dependent on the data source type chosen. Normally it will be
               numeric, but the data acquisition modules may impose their very
               own parsing of this parameter as long as the colon (::) remains
               the data source value separator.

       The following environment variables may be used to change the behavior
       of "rrdtool update":

       RRRRDDCCAACCHHEEDD__AADDDDRREESSSS
           If this environment variable is set it will have the same effect as
           specifying the "--daemon" option on the command line. If both are
           present, the command line argument takes precedence.

          "rrdtool update demo1.rrd N:3.44:3.15:U:23"

           Update the database file demo1.rrd with 3 known and one _*_U_N_K_N_O_W_N_*
           value. Use the current time as the update time.

          "rrdtool update demo2.rrd 887457267:U 887457521:22 887457903:2.7"

           Update the database file demo2.rrd which expects data from a single
           data-source, three times. First with an _*_U_N_K_N_O_W_N_* value then with
           two regular readings. The update interval seems to be around 300
           seconds.

          "rrdtool update demo3.rrd -- -5:21 N:42"

           Update the database file demo3.rrd two times, using five seconds in
           the past and the current time as the update times.

          "rrdtool update --cache /var/lib/rrd/demo3.rrd N:42"

           Update the file "/var/lib/rrd/demo3.rrd" with a single data source,
           using the current time. If the caching daemon cannot be reached, do
           nnoott fall back to direct file access.

          "rrdtool update --daemon unix:/tmp/rrdd.sock demo4.rrd N:23"

           Use the UNIX domain socket "/tmp/rrdd.sock" to contact the caching
           daemon. If the caching daemon is not available, update the file
           "demo4.rrd" directly.  WWAARRNNIINNGG:: Since a relative path is specified,
           the following disturbing effect may occur: If the daemon is
           available, the file relative to the working directory ooff tthhee ddaaeemmoonn
           is used. If the daemon is not available, the file relative to the
