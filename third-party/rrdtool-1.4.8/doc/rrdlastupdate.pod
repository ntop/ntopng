The B<lastupdate> function returns the UNIX timestamp and the 
value stored for each datum in the most recent update of an RRD.

=over 8

=item I<filename>

The name of the B<RRD> that contains the data.

=item B<--daemon> I<address>

Address of the L<rrdcached> daemon. If specified, a C<flush> command is sent
to the server before reading the RRD files. This allows B<rrdtool> to return
fresh data even if the daemon is configured to cache values for a long time.
For a list of accepted formats, see the B<-l> option in the L<rrdcached> manual.

 rrdtool lastupdate --daemon unix:/var/run/rrdcached.sock /var/lib/rrd/foo.rrd
