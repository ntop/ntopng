followed by any of the examples below

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For your convenience some of the commands are explained here
by using detailed examples. They are not always cut-and-paste
ready because comments are intermixed with the examples.

    COMMENT:"          "

    COMMENT:"Minimum    "

    COMMENT:"95th percentile\l"
    AREA:ds0bits#00C000:"Inbound "

=head2 Offsetting a line on the y-axis

Depending on your needs you can do this in two ways:

=over

=item *

Offset the data, then graph this

    DEF:mydata=my.rrd:ds:AVERAGE

Note: this will also influence any other command that uses "data"

    CDEF:data=mydata,100,+
    LINE1:data#FF0000:"Data with offset"

=item *

Graph the original data, with an offset

    DEF:mydata=my.rrd:ds:AVERAGE

Note: no color in the first line so it is not visible

    LINE1:100

Note: the second line gets stacked on top of the first one

    LINE1:data#FF0000:"Data with offset":STACK

=back

=head2 Drawing dashed lines

Also works for HRULE and VRULE

=over

=item *

default style: - - - - -
    LINE1:data#FF0000:"dashed line":dashes

=item *

more fancy style with offset: - -  --- -  --- -
    LINE1:data#FF0000:"another dashed line":dashes=15,5,5,10:dash-offset=10

=back

=head2 Time ranges

    Last four weeks: --start end-4w --end 00:00
    January 2001:    --start 20010101 --end start+31d
    January 2001:    --start 20010101 --end 20010201
    Last hour:       --start end-1h
    Last 24 hours:   <nothing at all>
    Yesterday:       --end 00:00

=head2 Viewing the current and previous week together

    --end now --start end-1w
    DEF:thisweek=router.rrd:ds0:AVERAGE
    DEF:lastweek=router.rrd:ds0:AVERAGE:end=now-1w:start=end-1w

Shift the data forward by one week (604800 seconds)

    SHIFT:lastweek:604800
    [ more of the usual VDEF and CDEF stuff if you like ]
    AREA:lastweek#0000FF:Last\ week
    LINE1:thisweek#FF0000:This\ week

=head2 Aberrant Behaviour Detection

If the specialized function B<RRAs> exist for aberrant behavior detection, they
can be used to generate the graph of a time series with confidence bands and
failures.

   rrdtool graph example.png \
          DEF:obs=monitor.rrd:ifOutOctets:AVERAGE \
          DEF:pred=monitor.rrd:ifOutOctets:HWPREDICT \
          DEF:dev=monitor.rrd:ifOutOctets:DEVPREDICT \
          DEF:fail=monitor.rrd:ifOutOctets:FAILURES \
          TICK:fail#ffffa0:1.0:"Failures\: Average bits out" \
          CDEF:scaledobs=obs,8,* \
          CDEF:upper=pred,dev,2,*,+ \
          CDEF:lower=pred,dev,2,*,- \
          CDEF:scaledupper=upper,8,* \
          CDEF:scaledlower=lower,8,* \
          LINE2:scaledobs#0000ff:"Average bits out" \
          LINE1:scaledupper#ff0000:"Upper Confidence Bound: Average bits out" \
          LINE1:scaledlower#ff0000:"Lower Confidence Bound: Average bits out"

This example generates a graph of the data series in blue (LINE2 with the scaledobs
virtual data source), confidence bounds in red (scaledupper and scaledlower virtual
data sources), and potential failures (i.e. potential aberrant aberrant behavior)
marked by vertical yellow lines (the fail data source).

The raw data comes from an AVERAGE B<RRA>, the finest resolution of the observed
time series (one consolidated data point per primary data point). The predicted
(or smoothed) values are stored in the HWPREDICT B<RRA>. The predicted deviations
(think standard deviation) values are stored in the DEVPREDICT B<RRA>. Finally,
the FAILURES B<RRA> contains indicators, with 1 denoting a potential failure.

All of the data is rescaled to bits (instead of Octets) by multiplying by 8.
The confidence bounds are computed by an offset of 2 deviations both above
and below the predicted values (the CDEFs upper and lower). Vertical lines
indicated potential failures are graphed via the TICK graph element, which
converts non-zero values in an B<RRA> into tick marks. Here an axis-fraction
argument of 1.0 means the tick marks span the entire y-axis, and hence become
vertical lines on the graph.

The choice of 2 deviations (a scaling factor) matches the default used internally
by the FAILURES B<RRA>. If the internal value is changed (see L<rrdtune>), this
graphing command should be changed to be consistent.

=head3 A note on data reduction:

The B<rrdtool> I<graph> command is designed to plot data at a specified temporal
resolution, regardless of the actually resolution of the data in the RRD file.
This can present a problem for the specialized consolidation functions which
maintain a one-to-one mapping between primary data points and consolidated
data points. If a graph insists on viewing the contents of these B<RRAs> on a
coarser temporal scale, the I<graph> command tries to do something intelligent,
but the confidence bands and failures no longer have the same meaning and may
be misleading.
