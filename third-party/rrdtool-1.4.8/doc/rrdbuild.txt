       rrdbuild - Instructions for building RRDtool

OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW
       If you downloaded the source of RRDtool you have to compile it. This
       document will give some information on how this is done.

       RRDtool relies on services of third part libraries. Some of these
       libraries may already be installed on your system. You have to compile
       copies of the other ones before you can build RRDtool.

       This document will tell you about all the necessary steps to get going.

       These instructions assume you are using a bbaasshh shell. If you use
       csh/tcsh, then you can either type _b_a_s_h to switch to bash for the
       compilation or if you know what you are doing just replace the export
       bits with setenv.

       We further assume that your copies of ttaarr and mmaakkee are actually GGNNUU ttaarr
       and GGNNUU mmaakkee respectively. It could be that they are installed as ggttaarr
       and ggmmaakkee on your system.

OOPPTTIIMMIISSTTIICC BBUUIILLDD
       Before you start to build RRDtool, you have to decide two things:

       1.  In which directory you want to build the software.

       2.  Where you want to install the software.

       Once you have decided. Save the two locations into environment
       variables.

        BUILD_DIR=/tmp/rrdbuild
        INSTALL_DIR=/opt/rrdtool-1.4.8

       If your _/_t_m_p is mounted with the option noexec (RHEL seems todo that)
       you have to choose a different directory!

       Now make sure the BUILD_DIR exists and go there:

        mkdir -p $BUILD_DIR
        cd $BUILD_DIR

       Lets first assume you already have all the necessary libraries pre-
       installed.

        wget http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/rrdtool-1.4.8.tar.gz
        gunzip -c rrdtool-1.4.8.tar.gz | tar xf -
        cd rrdtool-1.4.8
        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR && make && make install

       Ok, this was very optimistic. This try will probably have ended with
       ccoonnffiigguurree complaining about several missing libraries.

IINNSSTTAALLLLIINNGG DDEEPPEENNDDEENNCCIIEESS
       If your OS lets you install additional packages from a software
       repository, you may get away with installing the missing packages. When
       the packages are installed, run configure again and try to compile
       again. Below you find some hints on getting your OS ready for compiling
       RRDtool.

       Additions to this list are welcome. In general RRDtool should work with
       the latest versions of the libraries. The versions listed here are just
       what was current when I tested this.

   OOppeennSSoollaarriiss 22000088..0055
       Just add a compiler and the gnome development package:

        pkg install sunstudioexpress
        pkg install SUNWgnome-common-devel

       There is a problem with _c_a_i_r_o_._p_c on OpenSolaris. It suggests that
       xrender is required for compilation with cairo. This is not true and
       also bad since OpenSolaris does not include an _x_r_e_n_d_e_r_._p_c file. Use
       Perl to fix this:

        perl -i~ -p -e 's/(Requires.*?)\s*xrender.*/$1/' /usr/lib/pkgconfig/cairo.pc

       Make sure the RRDtool build system finds your new compiler

        export PATH=/opt/SunStudioExpress/bin

   DDeebbiiaann // UUbbuunnttuu
       Use apt-get to make sure you have all that is required. A number of
       packages will get added through dependencies.

        apt-get install libpango1.0-dev libxml2-dev

   GGeennttoooo
       In Gentoo installing RRDtool is really simple you just need to eemmeerrggee
       rrrrddttooooll. All dependencies will be handled automatically by the portage
       system. The only thing you should care about are USE flags, which allow
       you fine tune features RRDtool will be built with. Currently the
       following USE flags are available:

        doc    - install .html and .txt documentation
                 into /usr/share/doc/rrdtool-1.x.xx/
        perl   - build and install perl language bindings
        python - build and install python language bindings
        ruby   - build and install ruby language bindings
        tcl    - build and install tcl language bindings
        rrdcgi - build and install rrdcgi

       After you've decided which USE flags you need, set them either in
       _m_a_k_e_._c_o_n_f or _/_e_t_c_/_p_o_r_t_a_g_e_/_p_a_c_k_a_g_e_._u_s_e and finally run:

        # emerge -va rrdtool

       Take a look at Gentoo handbook for further details on how to manage USE
       flags: http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=2

       But again this may have been too optimistic still, and you actually
       have to compile your own copies of some of the required libraries.
       Things like libpng and zlib are pretty standard so you will probably
       have them on your system anyway. Freetype, Fontinst, Cairo, Pango may
       be installed, but it is possible that they are pretty old and thus
       don't live up to our expectations, so you may want to compile their
       latest versions.

   GGeenneerraall bbuuiilldd ttiippss ffoorr AAIIXX
       If you are working with AIX, you may find the ----ddiissaabbllee--sshhaarreedd option
       will cause things to break for you. In that case you may have to
       install the shared libraries into the RRDtool PREFIX and work with
       ----ddiissaabbllee--ssttaattiicc instead.

       Another hint to get RRDtool working on AIX is to use the IBM XL C
       Compiler:

        export CC=/usr/vac/bin/cc
        export PERLCC=$CC

       (Better instructions for AIX welcome!)

   BBuuiilldd IInnssttrruuccttiioonnss
       Some libraries want to know where other libraries are. For this to
       work, set the following environment variable

        export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${INSTALL_DIR}/lib/pkgconfig
        export PATH=$INSTALL_DIR/bin:$PATH

       The above relies on the presence of the _p_k_g_c_o_n_f_i_g program. Below you
       find instructions on how to compile pkgconfig.

       Since we are compiling libraries dynamically, they must know where to
       find each other. This is done by setting an appropriate LDFLAGS.
       Unfortunately, the syntax again differs from system to system:

       Solaris
            export LDFLAGS=-R${INSTALL_DIR}/lib

           if you are using the Sun Studio/Forte compiler, you may also want
           to set

            CFLAGS="-xO3 -xcode=pic13"   (SPARC)
            CFLAGS="-xO3 -Kpic"          (x86)

       Linux
            export LDFLAGS="-Wl,--rpath -Wl,${INSTALL_DIR}/lib"

       HPUX
            export LDFLAGS="+b${INSTALL_DIR}/lib"

       AIX
            export LDFLAGS="-Wl,-blibpath:${INSTALL_DIR}/lib"

       If you have GNU make installed and it is not called 'make', then do

        export MAKE=gmake
        export GNUMAKE=gmake

       otherwise just do

        export MAKE=make

       _B_u_i_l_d_i_n_g _p_k_g_c_o_n_f_i_g

       As mentioned above, without pkgconfig the whole build process will be
       lots of pain and suffering, so make sure you have a copy on your
       system. If it is not available natively, here is how to compile it.

        wget http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/releases/pkg-config-0.23.tar.gz
        gunzip -c pkg-config-0.23.tar.gz | tar xf -
        cd pkg-config-0.23
        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC"
        $MAKE
        $MAKE install

       After installing pkgconfig in a custom directory, setting up the
       corresponding environment variable will be helpful.

        export PKG_CONFIG=$INSTALL_DIR/bin/pkg-config

       _B_u_i_l_d_i_n_g _z_l_i_b

       Chances are very high that you already have that on your system ...

        cd $BUILD_DIR
        wget http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz
        gunzip -c zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz | tar xf -
        cd zlib-1.2.3
        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC" --shared
        $MAKE
        $MAKE install

       _B_u_i_l_d_i_n_g _l_i_b_p_n_g

       Libpng itself requires zlib to build, so we need to help a bit. If you
       already have a copy of zlib on your system (which is very likely) you
       can drop the settings of LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS. Note that the backslash
       (\) at the end of line 4 means that line 4 and line 5 are on one line.

        cd $BUILD_DIR
        wget http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/libpng-1.2.18.tar.gz
        gunzip -c libpng-1.2.18.tar.gz | tar xf -
        cd libpng-1.2.10
        env CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC" ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR
        $MAKE
        $MAKE install

       _B_u_i_l_d_i_n_g _f_r_e_e_t_y_p_e

        cd $BUILD_DIR
        wget http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/freetype-2.3.5.tar.gz
        gunzip -c freetype-2.3.5.tar.gz | tar xf -
        cd freetype-2.3.5
        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC"
        $MAKE
        $MAKE install

       If you run into problems building freetype on Solaris, you may want to
       try to add the following at the start the configure line:

        env EGREP=egrep

       _B_u_i_l_d_i_n_g _L_i_b_X_M_L_2

        cd $BUILD_DIR
        wget http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/libxml2-2.6.32.tar.gz
        gunzip -c libxml2-2.6.32.tar.gz | tar xf -
        cd libxml2-2.6.32
        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC"
        $MAKE
        $MAKE install

       _B_u_i_l_d_i_n_g _f_o_n_t_c_o_n_f_i_g

       Note that fontconfig has a run time configuration file in
       INSTALL_DIR/etc you may want to adjust that so that fontconfig finds
       the fonts on your system.  Run the fc-cache program to build the
       fontconfig cache after changing the config file.

        cd $BUILD_DIR

       When building on Solaris you may want todo

        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR \
           --enable-xlib=no \
           --enable-xlib-render=no \
           --enable-win32=no \

       Now all the dependent libraries are built and you can try again. This
       time you tell configure where it should be looking for libraries and
       include files. This is done via environment variables. Depending on the
       shell you are running, the syntax for setting environment variables is
       different.

       And finally try building again. We disable the python and tcl bindings
       because it seems that a fair number of people have ill configured
       python and tcl setups that would prevent RRDtool from building if they
       are included in their current state.

        cd $BUILD_DIR/rrdtool-1.4.8
        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR --disable-tcl --disable-python
        $MAKE clean
        $MAKE
        $MAKE install

       SOLARIS HINT: if you want to build  the Perl module for the native Perl
       (the one shipping with Solaris) you will need the Sun Forte compiler
       installed on your box or you have to hand-tune
       bindings/perl-shared/Makefile while building!

       Now go to _$_I_N_S_T_A_L_L___D_I_R//sshhaarree//rrrrddttooooll//eexxaammpplleess// and run them to see if
       your build has been successful.
