       detailed examples. They are not always cut-and-paste ready because
       comments are intermixed with the examples.

       Depending on your needs you can do this in two ways:

          Offset the data, then graph this

               DEF:mydata=my.rrd:ds:AVERAGE

           Note: this will also influence any other command that uses "data"

               CDEF:data=mydata,100,+
               LINE1:data#FF0000:"Data with offset"

          Graph the original data, with an offset

               DEF:mydata=my.rrd:ds:AVERAGE

           Note: no color in the first line so it is not visible

               LINE1:100

           Note: the second line gets stacked on top of the first one

               LINE1:data#FF0000:"Data with offset":STACK

       If the specialized function RRRRAAss exist for aberrant behavior detection,
       they can be used to generate the graph of a time series with confidence
       bands and failures.

                 LINE1:scaledupper#ff0000:"Upper Confidence Bound: Average bits out" \
                 LINE1:scaledlower#ff0000:"Lower Confidence Bound: Average bits out"

       This example generates a graph of the data series in blue (LINE2 with
       the scaledobs virtual data source), confidence bounds in red
       (scaledupper and scaledlower virtual data sources), and potential
       failures (i.e. potential aberrant aberrant behavior) marked by vertical
       yellow lines (the fail data source).

       The raw data comes from an AVERAGE RRRRAA, the finest resolution of the
       observed time series (one consolidated data point per primary data
       point). The predicted (or smoothed) values are stored in the HWPREDICT
       RRRRAA. The predicted deviations (think standard deviation) values are
       stored in the DEVPREDICT RRRRAA. Finally, the FAILURES RRRRAA contains
       indicators, with 1 denoting a potential failure.

       All of the data is rescaled to bits (instead of Octets) by multiplying
       by 8.  The confidence bounds are computed by an offset of 2 deviations
       both above and below the predicted values (the CDEFs upper and lower).
       Vertical lines indicated potential failures are graphed via the TICK
       graph element, which converts non-zero values in an RRRRAA into tick
       marks. Here an axis-fraction argument of 1.0 means the tick marks span
       the entire y-axis, and hence become vertical lines on the graph.

       The choice of 2 deviations (a scaling factor) matches the default used
       internally by the FAILURES RRRRAA. If the internal value is changed (see
       rrdtune), this graphing command should be changed to be consistent.

       _A _n_o_t_e _o_n _d_a_t_a _r_e_d_u_c_t_i_o_n_:

       The rrrrddttooooll _g_r_a_p_h command is designed to plot data at a specified
       temporal resolution, regardless of the actually resolution of the data
       in the RRD file.  This can present a problem for the specialized
       consolidation functions which maintain a one-to-one mapping between
       primary data points and consolidated data points. If a graph insists on
       viewing the contents of these RRRRAAss on a coarser temporal scale, the
       _g_r_a_p_h command tries to do something intelligent, but the confidence
       bands and failures no longer have the same meaning and may be
       misleading.

       rrdgraph gives an overview of how rrrrddttooooll ggrraapphh works.  rrdgraph_data
       describes DDEEFF,CCDDEEFF and VVDDEEFF in detail.  rrdgraph_rpn describes the RRPPNN
       language used in the xxDDEEFF statements.  rrdgraph_graph page describes
       all the graph and print functions.
