\&\fI\s-1RPN\s0 expression\fR:=\fIvname\fR|\fIoperator\fR|\fIvalue\fR[,\fI\s-1RPN\s0 expression\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
If you have ever used a traditional \s-1HP\s0 calculator you already know
\&\fB\s-1RPN\s0\fR (Reverse Polish Notation).
The idea behind \fB\s-1RPN\s0\fR is that you have a stack and push
your data onto this stack. Whenever you execute an operation, it
takes as many elements from the stack as needed. Pushing is done
implicitly, so whenever you specify a number or a variable, it gets
pushed onto the stack automatically.
.PP
At the end of the calculation there should be one and only one value left on
the stack.  This is the outcome of the function and this is what is put into
the \fIvname\fR.  For \fB\s-1CDEF\s0\fR instructions, the stack is processed for each
data point on the graph. \fB\s-1VDEF\s0\fR instructions work on an entire data set in
one run. Note, that currently \fB\s-1VDEF\s0\fR instructions only support a limited
list of functions.
.PP
Example: \f(CW\*(C`VDEF:maximum=mydata,MAXIMUM\*(C'\fR
.PP
This will set variable \*(L"maximum\*(R" which you now can use in the rest
of your \s-1RRD\s0 script.
.PP
Example: \f(CW\*(C`CDEF:mydatabits=mydata,8,*\*(C'\fR
.PP
This means:  push variable \fImydata\fR, push the number 8, execute
the operator \fI*\fR. The operator needs two elements and uses those
to return one value.  This value is then stored in \fImydatabits\fR.
As you may have guessed, this instruction means nothing more than
\&\fImydatabits = mydata * 8\fR.  The real power of \fB\s-1RPN\s0\fR lies in the
fact that it is always clear in which order to process the input.
For expressions like \f(CW\*(C`a = b + 3 * 5\*(C'\fR you need to multiply 3 with
5 first before you add \fIb\fR to get \fIa\fR. However, with parentheses
you could change this order: \f(CW\*(C`a = (b + 3) * 5\*(C'\fR. In \fB\s-1RPN\s0\fR, you
would do \f(CW\*(C`a = b, 3, +, 5, *\*(C'\fR without the need for parentheses.

\&\fB\s-1LT\s0, \s-1LE\s0, \s-1GT\s0, \s-1GE\s0, \s-1EQ\s0, \s-1NE\s0\fR
.Sp
Pop two elements from the stack, compare them for the selected condition
and return 1 for true or 0 for false. Comparing an \fIunknown\fR or an
\&\fIinfinite\fR value will result in \fIunknown\fR returned ... which will also be
treated as false by the \fB\s-1IF\s0\fR call.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1UN\s0, \s-1ISINF\s0\fR
.Sp
Pop one element from the stack, compare this to \fIunknown\fR respectively
to \fIpositive or negative infinity\fR. Returns 1 for true or 0 for false.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1IF\s0\fR
.Sp
Pops three elements from the stack.  If the element popped last is 0
(false), the value popped first is pushed back onto the stack,
otherwise the value popped second is pushed back. This does, indeed,
mean that any value other than 0 is considered to be true.
.Sp
Example: \f(CW\*(C`A,B,C,IF\*(C'\fR should be read as \f(CW\*(C`if (A) then (B) else (C)\*(C'\fR
.Sp

.IP "Comparing values" 4
.IX Item "Comparing values"
\&\fB\s-1MIN\s0, \s-1MAX\s0\fR
.Sp
Pops two elements from the stack and returns the smaller or larger,
respectively.  Note that \fIinfinite\fR is larger than anything else.
If one of the input numbers is \fIunknown\fR then the result of the operation will be
\&\fIunknown\fR too.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1LIMIT\s0\fR
.Sp
Pops two elements from the stack and uses them to define a range.
Then it pops another element and if it falls inside the range, it
is pushed back. If not, an \fIunknown\fR is pushed.
.Sp
The range defined includes the two boundaries (so: a number equal
to one of the boundaries will be pushed back). If any of the three
numbers involved is either \fIunknown\fR or \fIinfinite\fR this function
will always return an \fIunknown\fR
.Sp
Example: \f(CW\*(C`CDEF:a=alpha,0,100,LIMIT\*(C'\fR will return \fIunknown\fR if
alpha is lower than 0 or if it is higher than 100.

NAN-safe addition. If one parameter is \s-1NAN/UNKNOWN\s0 it'll be treated as
zero. If both parameters are \s-1NAN/UNKNOWN\s0, \s-1NAN/UNKNOWN\s0 will be returned.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1SIN\s0, \s-1COS\s0, \s-1LOG\s0, \s-1EXP\s0, \s-1SQRT\s0\fR

square root.

.Sp
Arctangent (output in radians).
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1ATAN2\s0\fR
.Sp
Arctangent of y,x components (output in radians).
This pops one element from the stack, the x (cosine) component, and then
a second, which is the y (sine) component.
It then pushes the arctangent of their ratio, resolving the ambiguity between
quadrants.
.Sp
Example: \f(CW\*(C`CDEF:angle=Y,X,ATAN2,RAD2DEG\*(C'\fR will convert \f(CW\*(C`X,Y\*(C'\fR
components into an angle in degrees.

\&\fB\s-1SORT\s0, \s-1REV\s0\fR
.Sp
Pop one element from the stack.  This is the \fIcount\fR of items to be sorted
(or reversed).  The top \fIcount\fR of the remaining elements are then sorted
(or reversed) in place on the stack.
.Sp
Example: \f(CW\*(C`CDEF:x=v1,v2,v3,v4,v5,v6,6,SORT,POP,5,REV,POP,+,+,+,4,/\*(C'\fR will
compute the average of the values v1 to v6 after removing the smallest and
largest.

.Sp
Pop one element (\fIcount\fR) from the stack. Now pop \fIcount\fR elements and build the
average, ignoring all \s-1UNKNOWN\s0 values in the process.

\&\s-1TRENDNAN\s0 is \- in contrast to \s-1TREND\s0 \- NAN-safe. If you use \s-1TREND\s0 and one 
source value is \s-1NAN\s0 the complete sliding window is affected. The \s-1TRENDNAN\s0 
operation ignores all NAN-values in a sliding window and computes the 
average of the remaining values.

The function is by design NAN-safe. 
This also allows for extrapolation into the future (say a few days)
\&\- you may need to define the data series whit the optional start= parameter, so that 
the source data series has enough data to provide prediction also at the beginning of a graph...
.Sp
Here an example, that will create a 10 day graph that also shows the 
prediction 3 days into the future with its uncertainty value (as defined by avg+\-4*sigma)
This also shows if the prediction is exceeded at a certain point.

This should follow a \fB\s-1DEF\s0\fR or \fB\s-1CDEF\s0\fR \fIvname\fR. The \fIvname\fR is popped,
another number is popped which is a certain percentage (0..100). The
data set is then sorted and the value returned is chosen such that
\&\fIpercentage\fR percent of the values is lower or equal than the result.
For \s-1PERCENTNAN\s0 \fIUnknown\fR values are ignored, but for \s-1PERCENT\s0
\&\fIUnknown\fR values are considered lower than any finite number for this
purpose so if this operator returns an \fIunknown\fR you have quite a lot
of them in your data.  \fBInf\fRinite numbers are lesser, or more, than the
finite numbers and are always more than the \fIUnknown\fR numbers.
(NaN < \-INF < finite values < \s-1INF\s0)

Return the parameters for a \fBL\fReast \fBS\fRquares \fBL\fRine \fI(y = mx +b)\fR 
which approximate the provided dataset.  \s-1LSLSLOPE\s0 is the slope \fI(m)\fR of
the line related to the \s-1COUNT\s0 position of the data.  \s-1LSLINT\s0 is the 
y\-intercept \fI(b)\fR, which happens also to be the first data point on the 
graph. \s-1LSLCORREL\s0 is the Correlation Coefficient (also know as Pearson's 
Product Moment Correlation Coefficient).  It will range from 0 to +/\-1 
and represents the quality of fit for the approximation.
