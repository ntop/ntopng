       rrrrddccggii is a sort of very limited script interpreter. Its purpose is to
       run as a cgi-program and parse a web page template containing special
       <RRD:: tags. rrrrddccggii will interpret and act according to these tags.  In
       the end it will printout a web page including the necessary CGI
       headers.

       rrrrddccggii parses the contents of the template in 3 steps. In each step it
       looks only for a subset of tags. This allows nesting of tags.

       The argument parser uses the same semantics as you are used from your
       C-shell.

       ----ffiilltteerr
               Assume that rrdcgi is run as a filter and not as a cgi.

   KKeeyywwoorrddss
       RRD::CV _n_a_m_e
               Inserts the CGI variable of the given name.

       RRD::CV::QUOTE _n_a_m_e
               Inserts the CGI variable of the given name but quotes it, ready
               for use as an argument in another RRD:: tag. So even when there
               are spaces in the value of the CGI variable it will still be
               considered to be one argument.

       RRD::CV::PATH _n_a_m_e
               Inserts the CGI variable of the given name, quotes it and makes
               sure it starts neither with a '/' nor contains '..'. This is to
               make sure that no problematic pathnames can be introduced
               through the CGI interface.

       RRD::GETENV _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e
               Get the value of an environment variable.

                <RRD::GETENV REMOTE_USER>

               might give you the name of the remote user given you are using
               some sort of access control on the directory.

       RRD::GOODFOR _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
               Specify the number of seconds this page should remain valid.
               This will prompt the rrdcgi to output a Last-Modified, an
               Expire and if the number of seconds is _n_e_g_a_t_i_v_e a Refresh
               header.

       RRD::INCLUDE _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
               Include the contents of the specified file into the page
               returned from the cgi.

       RRD::SETENV _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e _v_a_l_u_e
               If you want to present your graphs in another time zone than
               your own, you could use

                <RRD::SETENV TZ UTC>

               to make sure everything is presented in Universal Time. Note
               that the values permitted to TZ depend on your OS.

       RRD::SETVAR _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e _v_a_l_u_e
               Analog to SETENV but for local variables.

       RRD::GETVAR _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e
               Analog to GETENV but for local variables.

       RRD::TIME::LAST _r_r_d_-_f_i_l_e _s_t_r_f_t_i_m_e_-_f_o_r_m_a_t
               This gets replaced by the last modification time of the
               selected RRD. The time is _s_t_r_f_t_i_m_e-formatted with the string
               specified in the second argument.

       RRD::TIME::NOW _s_t_r_f_t_i_m_e_-_f_o_r_m_a_t
               This gets replaced by the current time of day. The time is
               _s_t_r_f_t_i_m_e-formatted with the string specified in the argument.

               Note that if you return : (colons) from your strftime format
               you may have to escape them using \ if the time is to be used
               as an argument to a GRAPH command.

       RRD::TIME::STRFTIME _S_T_A_R_T_|_E_N_D _s_t_a_r_t_-_s_p_e_c _e_n_d_-_s_p_e_c _s_t_r_f_t_i_m_e_-_f_o_r_m_a_t
               This gets replaced by a strftime-formatted time using the
               format _s_t_r_f_t_i_m_e_-_f_o_r_m_a_t on either _s_t_a_r_t_-_s_p_e_c or _e_n_d_-_s_p_e_c
               depending on whether _S_T_A_R_T or _E_N_D is specified.  Both _s_t_a_r_t_-
               _s_p_e_c and _e_n_d_-_s_p_e_c must be supplied as either could be relative
               to the other.  This is intended to allow pretty titles on
               graphs with times that are easier for non RRDtool folks to
               figure out than "-2weeks".

               Note that again, if you return : (colon) from your strftime
               format, you may have to escape them using \ if the time is to
               be used as an argument to a GRAPH command.

       RRD::GRAPH _r_r_d_g_r_a_p_h _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s
               This tag creates the RRD graph defined by its argument and then
               is replaced by an appropriate <IMG ... > tag referring to the
               graph.  The ----llaazzyy option in RRD graph can be used to make sure
               that graphs are only regenerated when they are out of date. The
               arguments to the RRRRDD::::GGRRAAPPHH tag work as described in the
               rrrrddggrraapphh manual page.

               Use the ----llaazzyy option in your RRD::GRAPH tags, to reduce the
               load on your server. This option makes sure that graphs are
               only regenerated when the old ones are out of date.

               If you do not specify your own ----iimmggiinnffoo format, the following
               will be used:

                <IMG SRC="%s" WIDTH="%lu" HEIGHT="%lu">

               Note that %s stands for the filename part of the graph
               generated, all directories given in the PNG file argument will
               get dropped.

       RRD::PRINT _n_u_m_b_e_r
               If the preceding  RRRRDD::::GGRRAAPPHH tag contained and PPRRIINNTT arguments,
               then you can access their output with this tag. The _n_u_m_b_e_r
               argument refers to the number of the PPRRIINNTT argument. This first
               PPRRIINNTT has _n_u_m_b_e_r 0.

       RRD::INTERNAL <var>
               This tag gets replaced by an internal var. Currently these vars
               are known: VERSION, COMPILETIME.  These vars represent the
               compiled-in values.

       This script is slightly more elaborate, it allows you to run it from a
       form which sets RRD_NAME. RRD_NAME is then used to select which RRD you
       want to use as source for your graph.

       This example shows how to handle the case where the RRD, graphs and
       cgi-bins are separate directories

        #!/.../bin/rrdcgi
        <HTML>
        <HEAD><TITLE>RRDCGI Demo</TITLE></HEAD>

         --imginfo '<IMG SRC=/.../pngs/%s WIDTH=%lu HEIGHT=%lu >'
         --lazy --start -1d --end now
         DEF:http_src=/.../rrds/test.rrd:http_src:AVERAGE
         AREA:http_src#00ff00:http_src
        >
        </BODY>
        </HTML>

       Note 1: Replace /.../ with the relevant directories

       Note 2: The SRC=/.../pngs should be paths from the view of the
       webserver/browser
