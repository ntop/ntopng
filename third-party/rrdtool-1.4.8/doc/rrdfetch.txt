       The ffeettcchh function is normally used internally by the graph function to
       get data from RRRRDDs. ffeettcchh will analyze the RRRRDD and try to retrieve the
       data in the resolution requested.  The data fetched is printed to
       stdout. _*_U_N_K_N_O_W_N_* data is often represented by the string "NaN"
       depending on your OS's printf function.

       _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
               the name of the RRRRDD you want to fetch the data from.

       _C_F      the consolidation function that is applied to the data you want
               to fetch (AVERAGE,MIN,MAX,LAST)

               the interval you want the values to have (seconds per value).
               rrrrddffeettcchh will try to match your request, but it will return
               data even if no absolute match is possible. NNBB.. See note below.

       ----ssttaarrtt|--ss _s_t_a_r_t (default end-1day)
               start of the time series. A time in seconds since epoch
               (1970-01-01) is required. Negative numbers are relative to the
               current time. By default, one day worth of data will be
               fetched. See also AT-STYLE TIME SPECIFICATION section for a
               detailed explanation on  ways to specify the start time.

       ----eenndd|--ee _e_n_d (default now)
               the end of the time series in seconds since epoch. See also AT-
               STYLE TIME SPECIFICATION section for a detailed explanation of
               how to specify the end time.

       ----ddaaeemmoonn _a_d_d_r_e_s_s
               Address of the rrdcached daemon. If specified, a "flush"
               command is sent to the server before reading the RRD files.
               This allows rrrrddttooooll to return fresh data even if the daemon is
               configured to cache values for a long time.  For a list of
               accepted formats, see the --ll option in the rrdcached manual.

       In order to get RRDtool to fetch anything other than the finest
       resolution RRA bbootthh the start and end time must be specified on
       boundaries that are multiples of the desired resolution. Consider the
       following example:

        rrdtool create subdata.rrd -s 10 DS:ds0:GAUGE:300:0:U \
         RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:30:3600 \
         RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:90:1200 \
         RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:360:1200 \
         RRA:MAX:0.5:360:1200 \
         RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:8640:600 \
         RRA:MAX:0.5:8640:600

       This RRD collects data every 10 seconds and stores its averages over 5
       minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour, and 1 day, as well as the maxima for 1
       hour and 1 day.

       Consider now that you want to fetch the 15 minute average data for the
       last hour.  You might try

        rrdtool fetch subdata.rrd AVERAGE -r 900 -s -1h

       However, this will almost always result in a time series that is NNOOTT in
       the 15 minute RRA. Therefore, the highest resolution RRA, i.e. 5 minute
       averages, will be chosen which in this case is not what you want.

       Hence, make sure that

       1. both start and end time are a multiple of 900

       2. both start and end time are within the desired RRA

       So, if time now is called "t", do

        end time == int(t/900)*900,
        start time == end time - 1hour,
        resolution == 900.

       Using the bash shell, this could look be:

        TIME=$(date +%s)
        RRDRES=900
        rrdtool fetch subdata.rrd AVERAGE -r $RRDRES \
           -e $(($TIME/$RRDRES*$RRDRES)) -s e-1h

       Or in Perl:

        perl -e '$ctime = time; $rrdres = 900; \
                 system "rrdtool fetch subdata.rrd AVERAGE \
                         -r $rrdres -e @{[int($ctime/$rrdres)*$rrdres]} -s e-1h"'

       Apart from the traditional _S_e_c_o_n_d_s _s_i_n_c_e _e_p_o_c_h, RRDtool does also
       understand at-style time specification. The specification is called
       "at-style" after the Unix command _a_t(1) that has moderately complex
       ways to specify time to run your job at a certain date and time. The
       at-style specification consists of two parts: the TTIIMMEE RREEFFEERREENNCCEE
       specification and the TTIIMMEE OOFFFFSSEETT specification.

       The time reference specification is used, well, to establish a
       reference moment in time (to which the time offset is then applied to).
       When present, it should come first, when omitted, it defaults to nnooww.
       On its own part, time reference consists of a _t_i_m_e_-_o_f_-_d_a_y reference
       (which should come first, if present) and a _d_a_y reference.

       The _t_i_m_e_-_o_f_-_d_a_y can be specified as HHHH::MMMM, HHHH..MMMM, or just HHHH. You can
       suffix it with aamm or ppmm or use 24-hours clock. Some special times of
       day are understood as well, including mmiiddnniigghhtt (00:00), nnoooonn (12:00)
       and British tteeaattiimmee (16:00).

       The _d_a_y can be specified as _m_o_n_t_h_-_n_a_m_e _d_a_y_-_o_f_-_t_h_e_-_m_o_n_t_h and optional a
       2- or 4-digit _y_e_a_r number (e.g. March 8 1999). Alternatively, you can
       use _d_a_y_-_o_f_-_w_e_e_k_-_n_a_m_e (e.g. Monday), or one of the words: yyeesstteerrddaayy,
       ttooddaayy, ttoommoorrrrooww. You can also specify the _d_a_y as a full date in several
       numerical formats, including MMMM//DDDD//[[YYYY]]YYYY, DDDD..MMMM..[[YYYY]]YYYY, or YYYYYYYYMMMMDDDD.

       _N_O_T_E_1: this is different from the original _a_t(1) behavior, where a
       single-number date is interpreted as MMDD[YY]YY.

       _N_O_T_E_2: if you specify the _d_a_y in this way, the _t_i_m_e_-_o_f_-_d_a_y is REQUIRED
       as well.

       Finally, you can use the words nnooww, ssttaarrtt, eenndd or eeppoocchh as your time
       reference. NNooww refers to the current moment (and is also the default
       time reference). SSttaarrtt (eenndd) can be used to specify a time relative to
       the start (end) time for those tools that use these categories
       (rrrrddffeettcchh, rrdgraph) and eeppoocchh indicates the *IX epoch (*IX timestamp 0
       = 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC). eeppoocchh is useful to disambiguate between a
       timestamp value and some forms of abbreviated date/time specifications,
       because it allows to use time offset specifications using units, eg.
       eeppoocchh+19711205s unambiguously denotes timestamp 19711205 and not
       1971-12-05 00:00:00 UTC.

       Month and day of the week names can be used in their naturally
       abbreviated form (e.g., Dec for December, Sun for Sunday, etc.). The
       words nnooww, ssttaarrtt, eenndd can be abbreviated as nn, ss, ee.

   TTIIMMEE OOFFFFSSEETT SSPPEECCIIFFIICCAATTIIOONN
       The time offset specification is used to add/subtract certain time
       intervals to/from the time reference moment. It consists of a _s_i_g_n
       (++ or --) and an _a_m_o_u_n_t. The following time units can be used to specify
       the _a_m_o_u_n_t: yyeeaarrss, mmoonntthhss, wweeeekkss, ddaayyss, hhoouurrss, mmiinnuutteess, or sseeccoonnddss.
       These units can be used in singular or plural form, and abbreviated
       naturally or to a single letter (e.g. +3days, -1wk, -3y). Several time
       units can be combined (e.g., -5mon1w2d) or concatenated (e.g., -5h45min
       = -5h-45min = -6h+15min = -7h+1h30m-15min, etc.)

       _N_O_T_E_3: If you specify time offset in days, weeks, months, or years, you
       will end with the time offset that may vary depending on your time
       reference, because all those time units have no single well defined
       time interval value (1 year contains either 365 or 366 days, 1 month is
       28 to 31 days long, and even 1 day may be not equal to 24 hours twice a
       year, when DST-related clock adjustments take place).  To cope with
       this, when you use days, weeks, months, or years as your time offset
       units your time reference date is adjusted accordingly without too much
       further effort to ensure anything about it (in the hope that _m_k_t_i_m_e(3)
       will take care of this later).  This may lead to some surprising (or
       even invalid!) results, e.g. 'May 31 -1month' = 'Apr 31' (meaningless)
       = 'May 1' (after _m_k_t_i_m_e(3) normalization); in the EET timezone '3:30am
       Mar 29 1999 -1 day' yields '3:30am Mar 28 1999' (Sunday) which is an
       invalid time/date combination (because of 3am -> 4am DST forward clock
       adjustment, see the below example).

       In contrast, hours, minutes, and seconds are well defined time
       intervals, and these are guaranteed to always produce time offsets
       exactly as specified (e.g. for EET timezone, '8:00 Mar 27 1999 +2 days'
       = '8:00 Mar 29 1999', but since there is 1-hour DST forward clock
       adjustment that occurs around 3:00 Mar 28 1999, the actual time
       interval between 8:00 Mar 27 1999 and 8:00 Mar 29 1999 equals 47 hours;
       on the other hand, '8:00 Mar 27 1999 +48 hours' = '9:00 Mar 29 1999',
       as expected)

       _N_O_T_E_4: The single-letter abbreviation for both mmoonntthhss and mmiinnuutteess is mm.
       To disambiguate them, the parser tries to read your mind :) by applying
       the following two heuristics:

       1. If mm is used in context of (i.e. right after the) years, months,
          weeks, or days it is assumed to mean mmoonntthhss, while in the context of
          hours, minutes, and seconds it means minutes.  (e.g., in -1y6m or
          +3w1m mm is interpreted as mmoonntthhss, while in -3h20m or +5s2m mm the
          parser decides for mmiinnuutteess).

       2. Out of context (i.e. right after the ++ or -- sign) the meaning of mm
          is guessed from the number it directly follows.  Currently, if the
          number's absolute value is below 25 it is assumed that mm means
          mmoonntthhss, otherwise it is treated as mmiinnuutteess.  (e.g., -25m == -25
          minutes, while +24m == +24 months)

       _F_i_n_a_l _N_O_T_E_S: Time specification is case-insensitive.  Whitespace can be
       inserted freely or omitted altogether.  There are, however, cases when
       whitespace is required (e.g., 'midnight Thu'). In this case you should
       either quote the whole phrase to prevent it from being taken apart by
       your shell or use '_' (underscore) or ',' (comma) which also count as
       whitespace (e.g., midnight_Thu or midnight,Thu).
