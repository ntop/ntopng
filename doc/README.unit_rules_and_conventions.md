## Data-rate units

According to the SI unit rules and style conventions, ntopng uses a solidus (i.e., _slash_) to signify the [division of units](https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/checklist.html). 

ntopng uses **data rate units** that are multiples of bits per second (_bit/s_) and bytes per second (_B/s_). One byte consists of 8 bits, so that _1 Mbit/s_ (one million bits per second) is _0.125 MB/s_ (megabyte per second).

The abbreviation _bps_, although acceptable, is not used to mean _bit/s_ in ntopng.
