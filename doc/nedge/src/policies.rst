Policies
========

With nEdge policies is possible to set up customized rules to block or limit users traffic.

Policies are available with three granularities:

   - User protocol policy: provides rules on user protocols
   - User category policy: provides rules on user categories
   - User fallback policy: provides a default rule for the user

Protocol/Category Policy
------------------------

  User policies configuration page

A protocol or category policy has the following fields:

- The **policy**: it specifies if the protocol traffic should be limitited or blocked
- A **daily traffic quota**: a limit for the specified protocol daily traffic
- A **daily time quota**: a limit for the specified protocol daily time usage


Quotas
------

All the quotas are reset daily at midnight. Quotas cannot be applied to the "Not Assigned" user.

Active user quotas can be reviewed by clicking the "View Quotas" button for a user in the Users page.

A given protocol or category quota will be shown only if there has been some traffic for it since
midnight. It is possible to reset all the user quotas manually by clicking the "Reset Quotas" button.

Device Protocols Policies
-------------------------

nEdge supports defining per-device-type policies in a similar way as `ntopng does`_.

Such policies can be used to block possibly harmful device protocols, according to the
configured rules. Device Protocols Policies can be enabled from the user settings page:

It is important to note that such policies in nEdge only apply to
the *Not Assigned* devices. If a captive portal authentication is used, or the
administrator has manually assigned the device to a specific user, the device protocols
policies *will not* be applied. This also applies to Device Protocols alerts.

.. _`ntopng does`: https://www.ntop.org/guides/ntopng/advanced_features/device_protocols.html

Priority
--------

The policies are applied with the following priority:

- For *Not Assigned* devices, if a Device Protocol policy is defined as block, such policy is applied
- If a protocol policy is defined, the protocol policy is applied
- If the protocol protocol policy is set to `Default` and a category policy is defined,
  then the category policy is applied
- If both the protocol and category protocols are set to `Default`, then the `Fallback Policy` of
  the user is applied

As an example, supposing a `Social Network` policy is set to `Slow Pass`, and a `Facebook` policy
to drop, all the Facebook flow will be dropped, while other social networks like Twitter will
pass and they will be limited according to the `Slow Pass` bandwidth class.

There is an easy way to verify which policy would be applied to some protocol, the Policies Test page.

The image above shows that a computer device belonging to no user (*Not Assigned*),
connecting to Youtube would be rate limited according to the Slow Pass bandwith control because
there is a Protocol policy which states that.
