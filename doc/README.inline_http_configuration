nEdge can be configured via HTTP. During the startup process,
it will try to retrieve users configuration from
a URL that has to be specified in file:

/lua/modules/http_bridge_conf_utils.lua

Configuration must be returned in JSON format. An example
configuration is given in the file mentioned above.

---

For testing purposes, a simple python JSON web server is provided in

tools/serve_bridge_config.py

The aforementioned python file returns a basic JSON configuration that
can be used/adapted to configure ntopng.

---

Associating members to their host pools is done at runtime using the
following ntopng endpoint:

/lua/admin/manage_pool_members.lua

A valid JSON must be POSTed to this endpoint. An example
configuration is given in the file.

The JSON must contain one or more MAC Addresses and, for each MAC,
a valid host pool and an association rule must be specified.

Using curl, one can configure members as follow:

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"associations" : { "DE:AD:BE:EE:FF:FF"  : {"group" : "maina" ,  "connectivity" : "pass"}, "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"  : {"group" : "simon" ,  "connectivity" : "reject"}}}' "http://devel:3000/lua/admin/manage_pool_members.lua"

The endpoint responds with a status for each configured association.
The status can be used to determine if the association/disassociation
has completed successfully.
