HTTP authentication can be enabled from the ntopng preferences page.

{ "user": "username", "password": "password" }

User is granted if webservice return code 200, anything else
user is not granted. Content-type and answser content are not checked.

If you want to grant a user as an administrator, webservice must
reply a JSON like:
{ "admin": true }

HTTP authentication parameters are discussed below.
