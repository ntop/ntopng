RADIUS authentication can be enabled from the ntopng preferences page.

ntopng will request an Access-Request to a radius server and, if an Access-Accept
is returned, the user will be authenticated.

In order to distinguish between admin and normal users, a `Filter-Id` attribute is
used https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2865#section-5.11 . The `Filter-Id` for admin
users should correspond to the `RADIUS Admin Group` set into the ntopng RADIUS preferences.

# Setting up a FreeRadius server

Check out https://www.packet6.com/install-freeradius-ubuntu-server . `testing123` is the default
secret for localhost. In order to set up the Filter-Id attribute for a user, the following lines should be added to `/etc/freeradius/users`

```
testuser Cleartext-Password := "Password123"
  Filter-Id = "ntopAdmin"
```

In order for authentication to work properly, testuser must actually exist as a linux user
in the system where FreeRadius is installed.
