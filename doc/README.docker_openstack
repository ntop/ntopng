Using ntopng with Docker
------------------------

You can find
- Ready to go containers at https://hub.docker.com/u/ntop
- Docker files at https://github.com/ntop/docker-ntop


Docker+OpenStack
----------------

ntopng can be built as a docker container. You can read more about this
at http://www.ntop.org/ntopng/using-ntop-applications-with-docker-and-openstack/
where it is also explained how to download the container.

OpenStack users, at the same URL, can instead learn how to use ntop apps (including
ntopng) using the pre-built OpenStack VM image.
