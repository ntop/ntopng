ntopng can be built as a docker container. You can read more about this
at http://www.ntop.org/ntopng/using-ntop-applications-with-docker-and-openstack/
where it is also explained how to download the container.

OpenStack users, at the same URL, can instead learn how to use ntop apps (including
ntopng) using the pre-built OpenStack VM image.
