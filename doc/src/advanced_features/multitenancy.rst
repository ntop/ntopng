Multitenancy
===========

`Multitenancy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy>`_ is the ability to monitor information coming from various users (e.g. a span port) and show to individual users only the portion of traffic that they have generated or received, hiding all the rest of the traffic.

In order to do this you need to configure users by limiting their visibility to the subset of information they should view.

You can restrict users by means of:

  - Limiting their visibility to a selected network interface
  - Restricting the visibility only to specific hosts by setting the list of subnets they can view.

This setting in the User's page these properties.

You can dive into multitenancy by reading this `blog post <https://www.ntop.org/ntopng/using-multitenancy-in-ntopng/>`_ that covers examples and describes how to configure traffic in order to use ntopng with multiple users.
