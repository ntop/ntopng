SNMP
====

ntopng (Enterprise) is able to perform SNMP monitoring, providing
an overall visibility of every monitored device, and allowing a
drill-down of the monitored data down to every single device
interface.

Historical charts are available to understand the patterns of traffic
across devices and interfaces.

Alerts can be created, for example, when an interface changes its status
from up to down, or viceversa.

These blog posts explain in detail how SNMP monitoring in ntopng
works, and what are the best practices for its setup:
