Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to limit the list of accepted applications and their corresponding ports.

## TLS SELFSIGNED CERTIFICATE

- **Description**: A self-signed TLS certificate is one that has been created and signed by the same entity responsible for the domain being secured. This can be a potential security risk as these certificates are not verified by any trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
- **Possible attacks**: The detection of this risk in deep packet inspection signals a problem in the monitored network, as self-signed TLS certificates can allow for man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Attackers can intercept and modify communications, since the certificate is not verified by a trusted third party.
- **Remediation**: When detected, the remediation for this risk involves validating the necessity of using self-signed certificates. If they are indeed required (e.g., for internal testing purposes), implement a proper Certificate Authority (CA) and enforce its use to avoid MitM attacks. For production environments, always use trusted CA-signed certificates to ensure secure TLS communications.

## TLS OBSOLETE VERSION

- **Remediation**: Update the expired TLS certificate as soon as possible, ensuring it is issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). If the certificate cannot be updated immediately, consider disabling the service that uses this expired certificate or implementing alternative secure communication methods temporarily. Additionally, monitor network traffic for any suspicious activity and investigate any potential breaches.

## TLS CERTIFICATE MISMATCH

- **Description**: A TLS certificate mismatch occurs when the server presents a different SSL/TLS certificate than expected during the TLS handshake process.
- **Possible attacks**: The detection of this risk in deep packet inspection signals a problem in the monitored network, as it may indicate a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack or an unintended use of self-signed certificates. In either case, data being transmitted could be intercepted and potentially modified.
- **Remediation**: When this risk is detected, administrators should investigate the source of the TLS certificate mismatch. If it's a MitM attack, affected connections should be terminated immediately. If the issue is due to an unintended use of self-signed certificates, consider implementing proper digital certificate management and revoke the current self-signed certificate.

Additionally, consider implementing an updated signature database to include the unknown application in future inspections.

## Packets Received in Opposite Direction

- **Description**: Traffic flowing in the wrong direction on a network link is unusual and may indicate unauthorized activity or misconfigured devices.
- **Possible attacks**: This detection signals a problem in the monitored network as it could be an indication of man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, spoofing, or other forms of malicious activity attempting to intercept or manipulate data traffic.
- **Remediation**: When detected, investigate the source and destination of the suspicious packets. If found to be unauthorized, isolate the affected device(s) immediately and perform a thorough security assessment. Review network configurations for misconfigurations that might allow unexpected traffic flow and correct them accordingly. Additionally, implement strong access controls, encryption, and intrusion detection systems to help prevent such incidents in the future.

## HTTP OBSOLETE SERVER

- **Description**: Detection of obsolete HTTP servers in the monitored network
- **Possible attacks**: The use of obsolete HTTP servers can expose vulnerabilities that may allow for various attacks such as remote code execution, injection attacks, and denial-of-service.
- **Remediation**: Upgrade or replace the obsolete HTTP server with a secure and updated version to patch known vulnerabilities. Regularly apply security patches and maintain good hygiene practices like strong authentication mechanisms and access controls. Implement HTTPS where possible to encrypt communication between client and server.

## PERIODIC FLOW

- **Description**: A network flow is observed to recur at regular intervals, indicating an application utilizing a patterned behavior.
- **Possible Attacks**: This detection could signal a problem in the monitored network if it points towards applications using predictable patterns, which may be vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks that exploit this periodicity for amplification effects or synchronization attacks.
- **Remediation**: To secure the network when  PERIODIC FLOW is detected, consider implementing rate limiting strategies on the relevant applications and reviewing their configurations for any potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, ensure that intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) are configured to recognize and respond appropriately to DoS attacks or synchronization attacks targeting periodic flows. Finally, monitor these applications closely for abnormal behavior and tune deep packet inspection rules as necessary.
