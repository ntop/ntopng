#. **Description**: Unidirectional traffic is network communication that only flows in one direction. This alert may indicate that either server or client are not responding, due to service being down or communications to the flow end host being blocked.
#. **Possible attacks**: Detection of unidirectional traffic signals a problem as it might indicate an open port scan, denial of service attack, or other forms of malicious activity where the attacker does not expect a response from the targeted system.
#. **Remediation**: When NDPI UNIDIRECTIONAL TRAFFIC is detected, investigate the source and destination IP addresses, along with the port number. Close any open ports that are unnecessary or take appropriate measures to secure them. Implement network monitoring tools to identify and block further unidirectional traffic. Regularly update software packages and system configurations to ensure protection against emerging threats.

HTTP OBSOLETE SERVER
====================

#. **Description**: Detection of obsolete HTTP servers in the monitored flow
#. **Possible attacks**: The use of obsolete HTTP servers can expose vulnerabilities that may allow for various attacks such as remote code execution, injection attacks, and denial#.of#.service.
#. **Remediation**: Upgrade or replace the obsolete HTTP server with a secure and updated version to patch known vulnerabilities. Regularly apply security patches and maintain good hygiene practices like strong authentication mechanisms and access controls. Implement HTTPS where possible to encrypt communication between client and server.

.. _Risk 048:
  
PERIODIC FLOW
=============

#. **Description**: A network flow is observed to recur at regular intervals, indicating an application utilizing a patterned behavior.
#. **Possible Attacks**: This detection could signal a problem in the monitored network if it points towards applications using predictable patterns, which may be vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks that exploit this periodicity for amplification effects or synchronization attacks.
#. **Remediation**: To secure the network when NDPI PERIODIC FLOW is detected, consider implementing rate limiting strategies on the relevant applications and reviewing their configurations for any potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, ensure that intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) are configured to recognize and respond appropriately to DoS attacks or synchronization attacks targeting periodic flows. Finally, monitor these applications closely for abnormal behavior and tune deep packet inspection rules as necessary.
