Host Details
############

Host Details page is as follows.

A contextual menu with labels and badges appears right below the top toolbar. Menu entries are
dynamic, hence, some of them may not always be present.

Menu entries are discussed below.

Home
----

*Home* is the default view of the Host Details page and provides detailed information including host MAC
Address (or the last router MAC address if the host is remote), IP Address (with network mask if detected),
a toggle to activate/deactivate alerts for the host, a checkbox to enable packet dump for the specific host,
symbolic hostname (or IP address), location (local or remote), date and time of first and last packet seen
for the host, traffic breakdown, amount of traffic packets received/sent, number of flows as client/server
host. All of this information is also available in JSON format by clicking on the ‘Download’ link. The heat
map provides the Activity Map for each host. Each box represents one minute of traffic. By default, Activity
Map shows the last six hours, but it is possible to set a different timeframe using the controls.

visited websites, which are shown over the two most recent 5-minute
intevals. Newly visited sites are placed under the "Current
Sites". Every 5 minutes ntopng moves the "Current Sites" under "Last 5
