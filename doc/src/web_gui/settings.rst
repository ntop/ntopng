Backup Configuration
--------------------

The Backup Configuration entry downloads a copy of the ntopng
configuration, as a compressed tarball (.tar.gz). The following files
and directories are included in the backup:

- Configuration file (unless command line is used for providing the options)
- /etc/ntopng folder
- Runtime configuration (runtimeprefs.json)
- License file

Please note that on Windows systems the runtime configuration file only is provided.

Restore Configuration
---------------------

ntopng configuration can be restored by placing the compressed tarball
(downloaded via Backup Configuration) into the ntopng data directory
and restarting the service. The tarball must be named conf.tar.gz.

For example, assuming the default /var/lib/ntopng data directory has not been changed, one can
restore a previously backed-up configuration by placing the compressed
tarball in /var/lib/ntopng/conf.tar.gz and then issuing a
:code:`systemctl restart ntopng`.

.. note::

   After the restore, the compressed archive into the data directory
   is automatically deleted.

.. note::

   Restore is only supported for packaged ntopng installations on
   systems that use :code:`systemd`. Geeks and those who are building
   ntopng from source should have a look at script :code:`httpdocs/misc/ntopng-utils-manage-config`.
