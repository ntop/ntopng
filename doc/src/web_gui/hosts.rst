Hosts
-----

All hosts that have been seen monitoring network interfaces are show here. Column headers can be
clicked to sort results in descending (ascending) order of the clicked header. Additional sort options are
available in the top right corner of the table.
The table shown has several columns, including

- IP address, with optional country flag and OS logo (if detected)
- Location, either Local (the host belongs to a local network) or Remote (the host belongs to a remote
  network) — please note that this is not a geographical location
- Alerts, with the number of alerts associated to the host
- Name, having the resolved hostname (or a custom name, if set in any Host Details page)
- Seen Since, with the amount of time it has lapsed since the first packet sent/received by the host has
  been observed
- ASN, with the AS number (if available)
- Breakdown, showing a bar that gives visual insights in the use of both traffic directions
- Throughput, with the overall actual throughput of the host
- Traffic, with the total traffic exchanged by the host

  The All Hosts Page

Any host can be clicked to be redirected to its page, which is discussed below.

Host Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The host details pages provide many insights on the information collected for an host.

The navigation bar entries are discussed below. Since the entries are contextual,
some of them may be hidden.

Home
^^^^

*Home* is the default view of the Host Details page and provides detailed information including host MAC
Address (or the last router MAC address if the host is remote), IP Address (with network mask if detected),
a toggle to activate/deactivate alerts for the host, a checkbox to enable packet dump for the specific host,
symbolic hostname (or IP address), location (local or remote), date and time of first and last packet seen
for the host, traffic breakdown, amount of traffic packets received/sent, number of flows as client/server
host. All of this information is also available in JSON format by clicking on the ‘Download’ link. The heat
map provides the Activity Map for each host. Each box represents one minute of traffic. By default, Activity
Map shows the last six hours, but it is possible to set a different timeframe using the controls.

Peers
^^^^^

Peers page presents a graphical overview of top contacted peers and top protocols used. In the following
screenshot some hosts are struck-through intentionally for privacy reasons. A table with top application
per peer is shown below the graphical overview. Every information is clickable to allow the user to drill
down and find insights.

Applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the DPI information, this page provides in pie chart and tabular format the amount of traffic divided
by application. An additional pie chart provides a statistics about protocol type. A click on the protocol
name redirects the user to the page with detailed statistics about the selected protocol.

TLS
^^^

.. figure:: ../img/web_gui_host_details_tls_info.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Host Protocols View

  The TLS View of the Host Details Page

ntopng registers the `JA3`_ TLS fingerprints of an host (either when the host is a client or a server) along with their the number of uses.
As explained in the `Flows section`_, this information is very important in order to uncover possible threats on the encrypted
traffic. By clicking on the signature it is possible to manually check if the JA3 signature
corresponds to a known malware into the `abuse.ch database`_.

By taking a snapshot of the signatures registered on an host it is possible to know, for example,
if the host has installed a new program or has updated an existing one. This may be very important
on environments where the programs installed into an host are not supposed to change.

By enabling the `nProbe Agent integration`_, this view can be further augmented
with the name of the process which initiated or received the TLS connection.

.. _`JA3`: https://github.com/salesforce/ja3
.. _`Flows section`: flows.html#tls-information

SSH
^^^

ntopng registers the `HASSH`_ fingerprints of an host, either when the host initiates or receives an SSH connection,
along with their the number of uses. As explained in the `related Flows section`_, this information can be used to identify
malicious applications or vulnerable SSH versions.

.. _`HASSH`: https://engineering.salesforce.com/open-sourcing-hassh-abed3ae5044c
.. _`related Flows section`: flows.html#ssh-signature

HTTP
^^^^

This page provides information about the HTTP protocol in terms of requests done and responses
received for each HTTP method, together with response codes. Counters are provided both as tables and
pie charts. In the case of virtual host being detected, a badge with the number of virtual hosts detected for
the same IP address is displayed in the host bar and an entry for each virtual server is displayed in a
virtual server table.

ntopng can keep track of top visited sites for any monitored local
host. Enabling the tracking of top visited sites requires preference
"Top HTTP Sites" to be set using the ntopng preferences page.

.. figure:: ../img/web_gui_visited_sites_preference.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Enabling Visited Sites

  The Preferences Page to Enable Visited Sites

Once the preference has been enabled, this page will start showing
visited websites, which are shown over the two most recent 5-minute
intervals. Newly visited sites are placed under the "Current
Sites". Every 5 minutes ntopng moves the "Current Sites" under "Last 5
Minute Sites", and starts over with a clean "Current Sites".

  :align: center
  :alt: Host Configuration

  The Host Configuration on the Host Details Page

In this page a user is able to give an Alias to an Host (an alternative name for an host that's going to be used in all ntopng), give a description to an host, 
assign this host to an host pool or hide this host from the Top Talkers computation.

Host Pools
----------

Host Pools are logical groups of hosts that are described in detail in the “Network Interfaces" section of
this document. This page show the list of defined and currently active Host Pools.

.. figure:: ../img/web_gui_hosts_pools_list.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Host Pools List

  The Host Pools List Hosts Page

Each row of the table shows, for each pool, the following information:

- The Pool Name as defined by the user during Host Pool creation
- A Chart icon to access historical pool traffic timeseries. Historical pool traffic charts must be enabled
  from the preferences page and are a feature that is only supported in the Professional version.
- The number of active hosts in the pool
- The number of alerts detected as the sum of host alerts for each host in the pool
- Seen Since, with the amount of time it has lapsed since the first packet sent/received by any of the
  hosts in the pool has been observed
- Breakdown, showing a bar that gives visual insights in the use of both pool traffic directions
- Throughput, with the overall actual throughput of the pool
- Traffic, with the total traffic exchanged by the pool

Host pools can be configured from the `network interface page`_.

Pools can be created or managed from the *System* interface, 
*Pools* menu. It is possible to add new pools using the “plus” button in the same page.

.. figure:: ../img/web_gui_interfaces_edit_pools.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Edit Pools

  The Pools Page

Once an Host Pool is created, it is possible to add members to it. Host Pool members can be added 
from the *Pools* > *Host Pool Members* page, using the “plus” button.

.. figure:: ../img/web_gui_interfaces_edit_host_pool.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Edit Host Pool

  The Host Pool Page

The Host Pools configuration, which includes the definition of host pools along with
the pools members, can be easily exported to JSON and imported into another ntopng instance
from the *Settings* > *Manage Configuration* page. Imported host pools will replace the existing ones.

An “Alias” can be associated to each pool member to ease the its identification. Typically, one would
assign a mnemonic label as member alias (e.g., “John’s iPhone” or “Smart TV”).

A view of host pool statistics is accessible from the actual interface, *Hosts* > *Host Pools* menu,
as discussed in the `relevant section`_. The view shows live pool information (e.g., overall pool throughput)
and provides access to the historical pool traffic timeseries (Professional version) as well as to the 
currently active pool members.

.. _`relevant section`: hosts.html#host-pools
.. _HostPools:
.. _`network interface page`: interfaces.html#host-pools

Traffic Policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Host pools can also be used to enforce traffic policies (e.g, block YouTube traffic for the “John” pool and
limit Facebook traffic at 1 Mbps for the “Guests” pool). This feature is available in nEdge (when ntopng is
used inline as described in the “Advanced Features” section of this document), or when ntopng is used in 
combination with `nProbe in IPS mode <https://www.ntop.org/guides/nprobe/ips_mode.html>`_ (see :ref:`UsingNtopngWithNprobeIPS`).

Networks
--------

Networks shows all networks discovered by ntopng.

.. figure:: ../img/web_gui_hosts_networks_list.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Networks List

  The Networks Summary Page

For each network discovered ntopng provides the number of hosts, alerts triggered, date of discovery,
breakdown, throughput and traffic. Network names can be clicked to display the hosts lists inside the
network selected.
