Report
######

The Professional version of ntopng allows to generate custom traffic reports for one or more interfaces
monitored. Report page, reachable from the dropdown home menu in the main toolbar, presents the
user with multiple configuration options.

Fixed-width temporal intervals are available on the left. They are 1h (one hour), 1d (one day), 1w (one
week), 1M (one month), 6M (six months), and 1Y (one year). A click on any of those intervals produces an
automatic report that spans a time range that starts at the present and that goes backwards in time until
the clicked interval is reached.

Exact temporal intervals can be chosen using the two dropdown date time pickers in the center. The first
and the second pickers are used to specify the start and the end of a custom report, respectively. Once
dates and times have been chosen, the report is obtained by clicking on ‘Generate’.

The small checkbox icon right of the ‘Generate’ button allows to select one or more of the available
monitored interfaces, as well as application protocols of interest. Clicking on it yields the following overlaid
menu.

Finally, the rightmost icon generates a printer-friendly report ready to be printed.

Reports contain charts of monitored interfaces overall traffic, local versus remote traffic, local networks
traffic, as well as the traffic grouped by:

- Application Protocols (e.g., HTTPS, Skype)
- Countries
- Local Hosts (hosts belonging to local networks) and Remote Hosts (hosts belonging to remote
  networks)
- Local Operating Systems
- Autonomous Systems

In the remainder of this section are screenshots of reported information discussed above.

Activity Report
---------------

In the enterprise version of ntopng it's also possible to get a detailed tabular
report of a single host, interface or network traffic over a specific time frame.

  Host Activity Report

.. warning::

   The report is currently *not available* when using InfluxDB as the timeseries
   driver.

The report provides daily, weekly and monthly details on the total traffic made
by the entity (host in this case) and the total duration the host has been active
on the network. It also provides the previous period data as long as comparison
columns to easily analyze the difference between the two periods.

Via the date picker at the top of the chart it's possible to easily jump to another
period. The right and left arrows provide a conveniente way to jump to the next and
previous period respectively. Via the "Today" button it's possible to jump to the
current day view, which show the traffic entity during the different hours of the day.

.. note::

  The report is based on the timeseries data. It is necessary to enable the traffic
  timeseries in order to display it.
