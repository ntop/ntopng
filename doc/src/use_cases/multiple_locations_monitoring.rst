Monitoring Multiple Locations
#############################

To monitor data from multiple locations, even geographically distributed, refer to :ref:`UsingNtopngWithNprobe` and to `Monitoring Multiple Locations <https://www.ntop.org/nprobe/network-monitoring-101-a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-ntop-tools/>`_. Dealing with public networks and firewalls is explained in blog post post `Best Practices for the Collection of Flows with ntopng and nProbe <https://www.ntop.org/nprobe/best-practices-for-the-collection-of-flows-with-ntopng-and-nprobe/>`_.

.. note::

	An nProbe Standard or nProbe Professional license is required for each location.
