Alerts
######

ntopng alerts are:

- Evaluated with Behavioural Checks for pools of hosts, interfaces, SNMP devices, and other network elements
- Delivered to recipients using type- or severity-based criteria

Contrary to tools based on signatures, ntopng is a behavioural-based tool. Below you can read more about available behavioural checks and how alerts are delivered to recipients.
