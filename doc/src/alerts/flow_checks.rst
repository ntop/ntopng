Blacklisted Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The system sends you an alert when a blacklisted host or domain is detected.

A Domain Name System Blacklist is a list that allows Internet Service Providers to block potentially malicious traffic - a blacklist contains domains, email addresses and IP addresses.
If one of them is blacklisted, it might have bad reputation and be insecure.

In case of domain -it might be suspicious website
In case of email- it might send spam
In case of host- it might conduct  suspicious activity

The goal of the check is to notify that one of above cases has been verified.

*Interface: Packet & ZMQ*

*Category: Cybersecurity*

*Enabled by Default*


Clear-Text Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Points out the unsafe application for you credentials.


Instead of using HTTPS some applications transmit passwords over unencrypted connections, making them vulnerable. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may spy on the victim's network traffic. This occurs when a client communicates with the server over an insecure connection such as public Wi-Fi, or an enterprise or home network that is shared with a compromised computer. To prevent this type of attack it's fundamental to use an encrypted communication transport-level (SSL or TLS) to protect all sensitive data passing between the client and the server.

The warning appears when the credentials have been inserted on the unsafe/encrypted channel.

*Interface: Packet & ZMQ*

*Interface: Packet & ZMQ*

*Category:Network*

*Enabled by Default*


DNS Data Exfiltration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verifies for data exfiltration.


The data is exchanged through DNS protocol on intermediate DNS servers. During the exfiltration phase, the client makes a DNS resolution request to an external DNS server address. Instead of responding with an A record in response, the attacker’s name server will respond back with a MX or TXT record, which allows a large amount of not structured data to be sent between attacker and victim.


The Alert is sent data exfiltration is detected.

*Interface: Packet*

*Category:Cybersecurity*

*Enabled by Default*


DNS Invalid Characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fragmented DNS Message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notifies that the message was fragmented.

DNS messages are sent via UDP. Even when fragmentation works, it may not be secure; it is theoretically possible to spoof parts of a fragmented DNS message, without easy detection for the receiver

The UDP protocol is effective and efficient with small responses. In the case of large packers, DNS resolvers should switch from using from UDP to TCP.

*Interface: Packet & ZMQ*
  
*Category: Cybersecurity*

*Enabled by Default*


Fully Encrypted Flow

Contacting an obsolete HTTP server could be dangerous.

The alert is sent when an host contacts an obsolete HTTP server.

*Interface: Packet & ZMQ*

*Category: Cybersecurity*

*Enabled by Default*


HTTP Susp. Content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check controls for HTTP content.

The system notifies when HTTP carries content in unexpected format (e.g. when the real content is not readable).

*Interface: Packet & ZMQ*

*Category: Cybersecurity*

*Enabled by Default*


HTTP Susp. Header
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HTTP Host header attacks exploit vulnerable websites that handle the value of the Host header in an unsafe way. If the server implicitly trusts the Host header, and fails to validate it properly, an attacker may be able to use this input to inject harmful payloads that manipulate server-side behavior. Attacks that involve injecting a payload directly into the Host header are often known as "Host header injection" attacks. 

The system notifies of suspicious HTTP header inserted.

*Interface: Packet & ZMQ*

*Category: Cybersecurity*

*Enabled by Default*


HTTP Susp. URL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A warning about clicked unsafe URL.

A secure website’s URL should begin with HTTPS rather than HTTP. The “s”  stands for secure and is using an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connection. Your information will be encrypted before being sent to a server.
Malicius URL -The simple act of clicking on a malicious URL, opening an attachment, or engaging with an ad can lead to serious consequences. By clicking on a malicious URL, you may find yourself the target of a phishing attack, have malware auto-install onto your device.

The Alert is sent in order to raise the awareness on this type of URL and to pay attention on final httpS URLs

*Interface: Packet & ZMQ*

*Category: Cybersecurity*

*Enabled by Default*


HTTP Susp. User-Agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The alert is sent when a suspicious User Agent is seen.

The User Agent is a string of text that identifies the browser and operating system for the web server. UA is transmitted in the HTTP header when the browser makes a request to the web server. 
User Agents are just "free-text" and might be used with malicious intentions the User Agent might be used to attack websites with:
    • SQL Injection via User Agent 
    • XSS with User Agent 
    • Spoofing User Agent to deceive the server 
      
The goal is to notify by making sure all the countermeasures are implemented.

*Interface: Packet & ZMQ*

*Enabled by Default*


HTTP/TLS/QUIC Numeric Hostname/SNI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Check is able to see a numeric IP Host.

DNS keeps the record of all domain names and the associated IP addresses. When you type in a URL in your browser, the DNS resolves the domain name into an IP address. In other words, DNS is a service that maps domain names to corresponding IP addresses.

Notifies in case of numeric IP Host.

*Interface: Packet & ZMQ*

*Category: Cybersecurity*

*Enabled by Default*


ICMP Data Exfiltration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Checks data Exfiltration by using ping.
 
The Internet Control Message Protocol is known by normal users via ping or traceroute, installed on every Operating System today. If ping is executed it will send an icmp packet with the flags - ICMP Echo Request, if the remote host wants to acknowledge this, it will respond with an “ICMP Echo Reply”. The protocol itself is used for testing of remote systems. 

Attackers can exploit this design choice to obfuscate malicious network behavior. Instead of explicitly communicating with a machine in the protocol of choice, each packet will be injected into an Echo or Echo Reply packet. 

The system sends an alert when detects a ICMP data exfiltration.

*Interface: Packet*

*Enabled by Default*


IEC Invalid Command Transition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check for the IEC 104 protocol used in Industrial Control Systems (ICS).

In IEC systems the transitions must respect the following criteria:
- m_to_c tranistions < 20
- c_to_m tranistions < 20
- c_to_m tranistions < 5

Whenever IEC transitions do not respect this rule, and alert is triggered
for the flow that does not satisfies these constraints.

*Interface: Packet*

*Category:Cybersecurity*

*Disabled by Default*

     
IEC Invalid Transition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check for the IEC 104 protocol used in Industrial Control Systems (ICS).

ntopng implements for every IEC flow a learning time (see preferences for changing its duration)
that keeps track of the transitions observed. Past the learning phase in case a
new transition (i.e. not previously seen) is observed, this check triggers
an alert that should not be confused with `IEC Invalid Command Transition`.

*Interface: Packet*

*Category:Cybersecurity*

*Disabled by Default*

     
IEC Unexpected TypeID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check for the IEC 104 protocol used in Industrial Control Systems (ICS).

that can be observed in a IEC flow. In case ntopng identifies a TypeID that
is not part of this list, an alert is triggered.

*Interface: Packet*

*Category: Cybersecurity*

*Disabled by Default*


Invalid DNS Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The system detects that the DNS is not correctly resolved.

Domain Name Server (DNS) hijacking, also named DNS redirection, is a type of DNS attack in which DNS queries are incorrectly resolved in order to redirect users to malicious sites.

Hackers haven’t forgotten or ignored DNS. In fact, it’s becoming an increasingly abused protocol to find command and control (C2) servers, control compromised systems, and exfiltrate your data. Threat actors are increasingly exploiting DNS.

Malicious DNS, include:
    • Domain-generation-algorithm (DGA) queries 
    • C2 data tunneled through DNS 
    • Data exfiltration via tunneled DNS 
    
The Alert is sent in order to notify that the system might have been compromised and changed the DNS server

*Interface: Packet & ZMQ*

*Category: Cybersecurity*

*Enabled by Default*


Known Proto on Non Std Port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Checks if all the apps are on the right port.

In order to avoid attacks aimed at standard ports, some organizations have turned to using ‘non-standard’ ports for their services. A non-standard port is a port that is used for a purpose not a default assignment. Using port 8080 instead of port 80 for web traffic is one example.
This is the strategy of ‘security through obscurity’. While it may keep cybercriminals confused for a while, it’s not a long-term security solution. Also, it can make connecting to your web server more difficult for users because their browser is pre-configured to use port 80.

Sends a notification in case the system detects an application is on unusual port.

*Interface: Packet & ZMQ*

*Category: Cybersecurity*

*Enabled by Default*


Large DNS Packet (512+ bytes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check for correct size of DNS packets.

DNS packets over UDP should be limited to 512 bytes. This size guarantees the datagram won't be fragmented because losing just one fragment leads to losing the entire datagram. When DNS packets overcome this threshold indicate a potential security risk or a misconfiguration.

The alert is sent in case the size overcomes 512 bytes.

*Interface: Packet & ZMQ*

*Enabled by Default*


Long Lived
~~~~~~~~~~
 
Checks for long lived flows.
 
The TCP source will keep sending as much data as it can for the transmission link and once congestion is occuring TCP congestion mechanism will come into play,TCP always initiate the congestion avoidance mechanism and slow-start if buffers get over-filled or output capacity of a router in the chain is smaller that the sum of its inputs.
 
An alert is sent when a flow lasts more than the configured duration.

*Interface: Packet & ZMQ*

*Category:Cybersecurity*

*Enabled by Default*


Missing SNI TLS Extn
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inspects if SNI is missed.

Often a web server is responsible for multiple hostnames – or domain names. Each hostname has its own SSL certificate if the websites use HTTPS.
The problem is, all these hostnames on one server are at the same IP address. This isn't a problem over HTTP, because as soon as a TCP connection is opened the client will indicate which website they're trying to reach in an HTTP request.
But in HTTPS, a TLS handshake takes place first, before the HTTP conversation can begin (HTTPS still uses HTTP – it just encrypts the HTTP messages). Without SNI (Server Indication Name) then, there is no way for the client to indicate to the server which hostname they're talking to. As a result, the server may produce the SSL certificate for the wrong hostname. If the name on the SSL certificate does not match the name the client is trying to reach, the client browser returns an error and usually terminates the connection.

Alert is sent to notify that TLS SNI is missing.

*Category:Cybersecurity*

*Enabled by Default*


Obsolete SSH Server Version or Cipher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Checks for obsolete SSH Version

It is possible to customize the supported SSH ciphers on the client machine when support is needed for a deprecated cipher. This is not a very common issue. It typically happens when a modern SSH client is used to connect to an old SSH server that hasn’t yet disabled weaker ciphers.

The system sends an alert to nitify an obsolete SSH version or Cipher.

*Interface: Packet & ZMQ*

*Category:Cybersecurity*

*Enabled by Default*


Old TLS Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Warns about an old version of TLS.

Sensitive data always requires robust protection. TLS protocols provide confidentiality, integrity, and often authenticity protections to information while in transit over a network. This can be achieved by providing a secured channel between a server and a client to communicate for a session. Over time, new TLS versions are developed, and some of the previous versions become outdated for vulnerabilities or technical reasons; and, therefore, should no longer be used to protect data.

Alerts when a new version of TLS is needed.

Susp. DGA Domain name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Warns about a suspicious domain that could be used with the scope to make survive the malware.

A domain generation algorithm DGA is a program that generates a list of domain names. DGA provide malware with new domains in order to evade security measures.
Continously changing domain names helps hackers to prevent their servers from being blacklisted. The idea is to have an algorithm that produces random domain names that the malware can use and quickly switch between them. Security software tools block and take down the malicious domains that malware uses but switching domains quickly enables cybercriminals to continue pursuing the attack without being detected.

The goal is notify that the system has detected a malware.

TLS (probably) Not Carrying HTTPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check identifies that HTTP content isn't transmitted in TLS protocol.

The main limitation of HTTP is that it is completely insecure. All traffic carried over HTTP is readable to the intruders. As the web carries more and more sensitive information due to ecommerce, online health records, social media, etc. this places more and more users’ sensitive data are at risk.
HTTPS uses the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol – to add security to HTTP. With SSL/TLS, HTTPS encrypts all traffic flowing between the client and the server.

Alert is sent when HTTP traffic is not encrypted.

TLS Cert Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check if TLS Certiicate works properly.

The name mismatch error indicates that the domain name in the SSL certificate (SSL certificate enables an encrypted connection) doesn't match the address that is in the address bar of the browser. 
if the domain name is associated with an old IP address that has not been changed and a different certificate is referring to the same IP address, then you may see a Common Name Mismatch Error. The problem can be solved by changing DNS record.

Alert is sent when a mismatch error in TLS Certificate is seen.

TLS Susp ESNI Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Checks for suspicious tls esni usage.

Server Name Indication (SNI) is an extension to the TLS protocol. It allows a client or browser to indicate which hostname it is trying to connect to at the start of the TLS handshake. This allows the server to present multiple certificates on the same IP address and port number.

The alert notifies about a suspicious tls esni usage.

TLS Unsafe Ciphers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Checks for secure TLS Cipher.

TLS is encrypting the communication between web applications and servers. To secure the data transfer, TLS uses one or more cipher suites, which is a combination of authentication or encryption. Using an old or outdated cipher makes vulnerable to attack. With an insufficient cipher, the attacker may intercept or modify data.

The Alert is sent when unsafe ciphers are seen.

Unexpected DHCP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Checks for unusual DHCP.

A DHCP server setup on a network by a hacker called Rogue DHCP server, can lead to Man in the Middle, Sniffing, and Reconnaissance attacks. By placing a rogue DHCP server on the network, an attacker can supply the clients with fake addresses and other network information to snoop into the data packets.


The alert is sent when the system identifies an unexpected DHCP server.

Unexpected DNS Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check for not allowed DNS servers.

DNS blocking is a filter method used to prevent Internet users visiting malicious websites. It works by comparing IP addresses against those assigned to websites known to be harmful or potentially threatning – those websites where malware and ransomware can be caught – dns blocking is implemented in order to prevent devices connecting with them when a match is found.

The Alert is sent when not allowed DNS server is detected.

Unidirectional Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Checks for “one way” data flow.
            
There are many situations in which a computer does not require a bidirectional flow
A connection on which a device may only transmit data or only receive data, but not both. That is, a source can transmit data to one or many destinations, but the destination(s) cannot transmit data back to the source because it is unable to receive.

The system sends a notification when detects in and out going data flows.

Unsafe protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The check identifies an insecure/unencrypted protocols.

Credential information submitted through telnet is not encrypted and is vulnerable to identity theft for this reason is not recommended.Users should instead use ssh https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell
Also,unecrypted ftp should not be used. Users wishing to transfer files between computers should instead use utilities sftp.

The alert is sent when important data is transmitted without any encryption.

XSS Attack
~~~~~~~~~~

The check verifies a possible XSS attack.

Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is a client-side code attack. The attacker aims to execute malicious scripts in a web browser of the victim by including malicious code in a legitimate web page or web application. The actual attack occurs when the victim visits the web page or web application that executes the malicious code. The web page or web application becomes a way to deliver the malicious script to the user’s browser. Commonly used for Cross-site Scripting attacks are forums, message boards, and web pages that allow comments.

The system sends an alert in case it has detected a possible XSS attack on the website.
