Traffic Reports
===============

When ClickHouse is enabled, a Reports page becomes available in the ntopng web GUI under the Dashboard > Reports menu.

This section describes how to use this functionality to build traffic reports on demand or automatically/periodically and get notified about their availability.

.. note::

   ClickHouse support including Historical Flows Explorer and Reports is only available in ntopng Enterprise M or above.

ntopng implements a flexible dashboarding engine that allows you to define custom reports by means of graphical components and data sources.
This means that multiple templates can be defined, according to the user requirements, to build reports with charts and data which is meaningful
for the specific user, network and use case. A dropdown at the top of the Reports page lets you select the desired template to be used to build
the report out of those available.

  Report Templates

The report is build using traffic information in a selected time frame. It is possible to select an arbitrary time interval by using the
dropdown and the range picker at the top of the Reports page.

Automatic Reports and Notifications
-----------------------------------

In addition to the manual Report generation, automatic reports can also be enabled in ntopng. This means that ntopng can build
for instance daily reports every night, with traffic information for the last 24h. In order to enable this, a global setting is
available under Settings -> Preferences -> Reports -> Daily Reports Generation. 

.. figure:: img/report-preferences-daily.png

  Automatic Report Preference

By enabling Daily Reports Generation, ntopng generates a report for every interface, every day. It is possible to disable automatic
reports on selected interfaces through the Interface -> Details -> Settings -> Create Daily Reports setting, which is enabled by
default after enabling the global setting.

When a new report has been generated and it is available, ntopng can also send a notification to inform the user, e.g. by sending an
email. In order to enable notifications, a Notification Endpoint and Recipient should be configured. In the Recipient configuration,
Traffic Reports should be selected as Notification Type.

Data Retention
--------------

All the reports stored on ntopng, both manually or automatically created, can be automatically deleted by ntopng after some time
in order to implement a data retention policy and avoid filling the disk due to the number of reports growing undefinitely.
There is a default data retention time configured in ntopng, this can be changed from the  Settings -> Preferences -> Reports -> 
Reports Data Retention section.
