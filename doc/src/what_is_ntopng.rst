What is ntopng
##############

ntopng is a passive network monitoring tool focused on flows and
statistics that can be obtained from the traffic captured by the
server.

Installation
============

ntopng is open source and available on `GitHub
<https://github.com/ntop/ntopng>`_. In addition, pre-compiled, binary
ntopng packages are available both for Linux and Windows. Installation
instructions for binary packages are available below.

Installing on Linux
-------------------

Installation instructions can be found at
http://packages.ntop.org/. Development and stable builds are
available. Stable builds are intended for production environments whereas
development builds are intended for testing or early feature access.

Installing on MacOS
-------------------

MacOS installation packages can be found at
http://packages.ntop.org/ and are installed with a GUI.
ntopng requires Redis to be installed in order to start. During the ntopng installation,
if Redis is not present, Redis is installed and activated, otherwise the one already installed on
the system is used. After the installation, ntopng is started and active on local port 3000
(i.e. ntopng is available at http://127.0.0.1:3000). If you want to uninstall ntopng you can
open a terminal and type :code:`sudo /usr/local/bin/ntopng-uninstall.sh`

To enable geolocation, MacOS packages require database files to be manually placed under :code:`/usr/local/share/ntopng/httpdocs/geoip`. Detailed instructions on how to obtain database files and install them are available at https://github.com/ntop/ntopng/blob/dev/doc/README.geolocation.md/. Once the files have been downloaded and placed in the folder, a restart of ntopng is necessary to read load them.

The ntopng configuration file is installed in /usr/local/etc/ntopng/ntopng.conf that can be edited
(as privileged user) with a text editor.

The ntopng service can be started/stopped using the launchctl command:

- [Start] :code:`sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.ntop.ntopng.plist`
- [Stop] :code:`sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.ntop.ntopng.plist`


Installing on Windows
---------------------

Only the development build binary is available for Windows. The binary can
be downloaded from the `Windows package repository
<https://packages.ntop.org/Windows/>`_.

Download the ntopng :code:`zip` file from the link above, locate it in
the filesystem, and unzip it to access the actual ntopng
installer. Double-click on the installer. The installation procedure
will start and ntopng will be installed, along with its dependencies.

The installation procedure installs

- ntopng
- `Win10Pcap
  <http://www.win10pcap.org>`_ drivers.
- `Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable
  <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads>`_
- `Redis <https://redis.io/>`_

.. note::

   If upgrading from an earlier version of ntopng for Windows, it is
   safe to skip the installation of any ntopng dependency. It is safe
   to respond 'No' or click 'Cancel' when prompted to install WinPcap
   drivers, Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable, and Redis.

By default, the ntopng installer comes with Win10Pcap drivers. However,
if using a recent Windows version (e.g., Windows 10), it is
recommended to install `npcap drivers <https://nmap.org/npcap/>`_
before installing ntopng and then, when prompted by the ntopng
installer, skip the installation of WinPcap drivers. npcap drivers are
better maintained but their license doesn't allow the redistribution
in the ntopng installer.

.. note::

   If Wireshark is already installed on Windows, then
   `npcap drivers <https://nmap.org/npcap/>`_ are already installed. In this case, it is
   safe to run the ntopng installer and skip WinPcap drivers
   installation, without any extra step to download or install npcap
   drivers.

The Windows package does NOT contain geolocation files, due to restrictions as
reported later in this section. So you need to download the geolocation files
and then copy them into C:\\Program Files\\ntopng\\httpdocs\\geoip\\ directory, and
then restart ntopng.
   
Versions
========

The ntopng software comes in four versions: Community, Professional, Enterprise M, Enterprise L
each version unlocks additional features with respect to the smaller one.

A full list of features and a comparison table is available in the ntopng 
`Product Page <https://www.ntop.org/products/traffic-analysis/ntop/>`_

ntopng Community
----------------

The Community version is free to use and open source. The full source code can be found on `Github <https://github.com/ntop/ntopng>`_.

ntopng Professional
-------------------

The Professional version offers some extra features with respect to the Community, which are particularly useful for SMEs, including graphical reports, traffic profiles and LDAP authentication.

ntopng Enterprise M
-------------------

The Enterprise M version offers some extra features with respect to the Professional version, which are particularly useful for large organizations, including SNMP support, fast MySQL export, advanced alerts management, high performance flow indexing.

ntopng Enterprise L
-------------------

The Enterprise L version offers some extra features with respect to the Enterprise M version, including Identity Management (the ability to correlate users to traffic). This version also unlocks n2disk 1 Gbit (Continuous Recording) and nProbe Pro (Flow Collection) with no need for additional licenses.

Licensing
=========

The Community edition does not need any license. Professional and Enterprise
versions require a license. ntopng automatically switches to one of these four versions, 
depending on the presence of a license.

License is per-server and is released according to the EULA (End User
License Agreement). Each license is perpetual (i.e. it does not
expire) and it allows to install updates for one year since
purchase/license issue. This means that a license generated on
1/1/2020 will be able to activate new versions of the software until
12/31/2021. If you want to install new versions of the software release
after that date, you need to renew the maintenance or avoid further
updating the software. For source-based ntopng you can refer to the
GPL-v3 License.

ntopng licenses are generated using the orderId and email you provided
when the license has been purchased on https://shop.ntop.org/.

.. note::

   if you are using a VM or you plan to move licenses often, and you
   have installed the software on a server with Internet access, you
   can add :code:`--online-license-check` to the application command
   line (example: :code:`ntopng -i eth0 --online-license-check`) so
   that at startup the license is validated against the license
   database. The :code:`--online-license-check` option also supports
   http proxy setting the :code:`http_proxy` environment variable
   (example: :code:`export http_proxy=http://<ip>:<port>`).

Once the license has been generated, it can be applied to ntopng
simply by visiting page "Help"->"About" of the web GUI and
pasting the license key in the license form.

Alternatively, the license key can be placed in a one-line file
:code:`ntopng.license`:

- On Linux, the file must be placed in :code:`/etc/ntopng.license`
- On Windows, the file must be placed in :code:`Program
  Files/ntopng/ntopng.license`

.. note::

   An ntopng restart is recommended once the license has been applied
   to make sure all the new functionalities will be unlocked.

.. _Geolocation:

Geolocation
===========

ntopng leverages `MaxMind <https://www.maxmind.com>`_ geolocation
databases to augment IP addresses with geolocation data as well as
information on Autonomous Systems.

.. note::

   To use geolocation in ntopng it is necessary to register for a free
   MaxMind account to obtain geolocation databases. Detailed
   instructions are available at `this page
   <https://github.com/ntop/ntopng/blob/dev/doc/README.geolocation.md>`_.
