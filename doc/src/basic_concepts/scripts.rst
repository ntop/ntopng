Scripts and Checks
==================

End users can extend the ntopng functionalities by creating scripts which
allow them, for example, to trigger custom alerts or provide new data visualizations
in ntopng.

Scripts can contain different resources, for example `localization files`_, `custom pages`_
and `Checks`_. The `Checks`_ are used to implement logic such as the triggering of alerts when a certain even occurs.

For an extensive discussion on how to develop new scripts check out the `scripts section`_ .
