Network Interfaces
##################

In general, network interfaces (or simply interfaces in the ntopng parlance) are pieces of hardware attached to devices such as computers, servers, smartphones and set-top boxes to allow them to communicate over a network. Network packets enter and exit an interface to make the communication possible. ntopng is able to monitor all the packets that enter and exit one or more interfaces, simultaneously.

Examples of interfaces are the wired ethernet `eth1` and `enp0s0` of a linux machine, as well as the wireless `wlan0`.
