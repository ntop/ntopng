.. _Plugin Examples:

Examples
========

A couple of examples are presented to give the reader a quick and direct
overview of ntopng plugins.

.. _Blacklisted Flows:

Blacklisted Flows
-----------------

Aim of this plugin is to trigger an alert every time a flow is found
to have its client or server (or both) in a blacklist. ntopng loads
custom and predefined blacklists as explained in :ref:`Category
Lists`. This plugin tests each flow for its client and server, and
possibly create an alert when they are found to be blacklisted.

Full plugin sources are available on `GitHub blacklisted flows plugin
page
<https://github.com/ntop/ntopng/tree/dev/scripts/plugins/blacklisted>`_.

The complete structure of the plugin is as follows:

.. code:: bash

	  blacklisted
	      |-- manifest.lua
	      |-- user_scripts
		  `-- flow
		      `-- blacklisted.lua
	      |-- alert_definitions
		  `-- alert_flow_blacklisted.lua
	      |-- status_definitions
		  `-- status_blacklisted.lua

As it can be seen from the file system tree, a plugin is a set of Lua
files, placed in predefined sub-directories.

The root directory, :code:`blacklisted`, carries a name which is
representative for the plugin. This directory contains other
sub-directories and a :code:`manifest.lua` (see :ref:`Manifest`) file containing basic plugin information:

.. code:: lua

	  --
	  -- (C) 2019-20 - ntop.org
	  --

	  return {
	     title = "Blacklisted Hosts",
	     description = "Detects blacklisted hosts and triggers alerts",
	     author = "ntop",
	     dependencies = {},
	  }

Sub-directories
:code:`alert_definitions` and :code:`status_definitions` contain Lua scripts necessary to define alerts and flow statuses. Specifically, :ref:`Alert Definitions`
define the alerts the plugin is going to trigger, whereas :ref:`Flow Definitions` define flow statues the plugin is going to set. In this specific plugin,
:code:`alert_flow_blacklisted.lua` tells ntopng the plugin is willing
to create an alert for blacklisted flows. Similarly,
:code:`status_blacklisted.lua` tells ntopng the plugin is going to set
a blacklisted status for certain flows. Those two directories, as said
by their names, contain just definitions of alerts and flow status,
the actual logic which sets the status and trigger the alert resides in directory :code:`user_scripts`.

As this plugin requires flows to carry on its task, directory
:code:`user_scripts` (see :ref:`User Scripts`) with the logic must contain a sub-directory
:code:`flow`, which, in turn, contains file
:code:`blacklisted.lua`. ntopng knows it has to execute
:code:`blacklisted.lua` against each flow it sees because
:code:`blacklisted.lua` is found under the :code:`flow` directory.

Let's have a look at the
contents of :code:`blacklisted.lua`:

.. code:: lua

   --
   -- (C) 2019-20 - ntop.org
   --

   local flow_consts = require("flow_consts")

   -- #################################################################

   local script = {
      -- NOTE: hooks defined below
      hooks = {},

      gui = {
	 i18n_title = "flow_callbacks_config.blacklisted",
	 i18n_description = "flow_callbacks_config.blacklisted_description",
      }
   }

   -- #################################################################

   function script.hooks.protocolDetected(now)
      if flow.isBlacklisted() then
	 local info = flow.getBlacklistedInfo()
	 local flow_score = 100
	 local cli_score, srv_score

	 if info["blacklisted.srv"] then
	    cli_score = 100
	    srv_score = 5
	 else
	    cli_score = 5
	    srv_score = 10
	 end

	 flow.triggerStatus(flow_consts.status_types.status_blacklisted.status_key, info,
	    flow_score, cli_score, srv_score)
      end
   end

   -- #################################################################

   return script


The first thing to observe, is that :code:`blacklisted.lua` contains a
single :code:`function` with a predefined
name :code:`script.hooks.protocolDetected`. This name tells
ntopng to execute the plugin for every flow, as soon as the flow has
its :code:`protocolDetected`, which is one of the several :ref:`User Script Hooks`
a plugin can attach to.

The body of the function has access to a :code:`flow` Lua table, with
several methods available to be called, among which
:code:`flow.isBlacklisted()`. Method :code:`flow.isBlacklisted()`
returns a boolean which is either true or false, depending on whether
any of the client or server is blacklisted. As this plugin wants to
trigger an alert then the flow is blacklisted, method is called and
tested in the first :code:`if`. When the flow is blacklisted and the
method returns true, a couple of scores are computed. **Scores** are
numbers associated to the client and server of the flow and attempt to
summarize how critical is the issue for both the client and the
server.

The client score is much higher when the server is blacklisted because in this case it is assumed that the client is infected and
attempting to contact malicious hosts. When is the client to be
blacklisted, then it may just be a scan attempt by a malicious host
and thus the score is lower.

Once the scores have been computed, the function calls
:code:`flow.triggerStatus`. This is the actual call that causes
ntopng to set the blacklisted status and trigger an alert! This call
wants the  scores as parameters, along with the flow status defined
in :code:`status_definitions` and an info table which contains certain
extra details and description of the flow blacklisted peers.

From this point on, the flow will appear as alerted and with status
blacklisted in the ntopng Web GUI, along with the scores specified for
its client and server. That is pretty much all to create a flow script.

A quick note on the :ref:`Web GUI` section. It has just a title and a
description that will be used by ntopng in the web GUI, to allow a user
to enable/disable the plugin.

.. _Flow Flooders:

Flow Flooders
-------------

Aim of this plugin is to trigger an alert when an host or a network is having more
than a predefined number of flows over a minute. As an host can be
either the client or the server of a flow, two types of alerts are meaningful in
this case, namely, a flow flood attacker alert and a flow flood victim
alert. The same reasoning can be applied to networks as well. A
network can either be considered a flow flood attacker or a flow flood
victim, depending on whether its host are the clients or servers of
the monitored flows. For the sake of this example, only flow flood victim alerts are considered for networks.

This plugin also exposes a threshold so that it can be configured from the :ref:`Web GUI`. The threshold is configurable on an host-by-host or CIDR basis. Indeed, a threshold which
is meaningful for an host is not necessarily meaningful for another host.

Full plugin sources are available on `GitHub flow flood plugin page
<https://github.com/ntop/ntopng/tree/dev/scripts/plugins/flow_flood>`_.

The complete structure of the plugin is as follows:

.. code:: bash

	  flow_flood/
	      |-- manifest.lua
	      |-- alert_definitions
	      |   `-- alert_flows_flood.lua
	      `-- user_scripts
		  |-- host
		  |   |-- flow_flood_attacker.lua
		  |   `-- flow_flood_victim.lua
		  `-- network
		      `-- flow_flood_victim.lua


From the file system tree, it can be seen that the plugin is
self-contained in :code:`flow_flood`, a directory which carries a name
representative for the plugin. The :code:`manifest.lua` (see :ref:`Manifest`) script contains basic information and description:

.. code:: lua

   --
   -- (C) 2019-20 - ntop.org
   --

   return {
     title = "Flow Flood detector",
     description = "Detects flow flood attacks and triggers alerts",
     author = "ntop",
     dependencies = {},
   }

This plugin doesn't work on flows, so no :code:`flow` directory is
present under :code:`user_scripts` and no :code:`status_definitions`
is necessary as it has been seen for the `Blacklisted
Flows`_. However, as this plugin generates alerts,
:code:`alert_flows_flood.lua` is needed under
:code:`alert_definitions` to tell ntopng about this.

The logic stays under :code:`user_scripts`  (see :ref:`User Scripts`) which
has two sub-directories: :code:`host` and :code:`network`, each one
containing Lua files with the logic necessary to trigger the
alert. ntopng will execute scripts under the :code:`host` directory on
every host and scripts under the :code:`network` directory on every
network.

Let's have a closer look at :code:`host` s :code:flow_flood_attacker.lua`, of the
scripts executed on hosts (the other Lua script are similar):

.. code:: lua

   --
   -- (C) 2019-20 - ntop.org
   --

   local alerts_api = require("alerts_api")
   local alert_consts = require("alert_consts")
   local user_scripts = require("user_scripts")

   local script = {
     default_enabled = true,
     default_value = {
       -- "> 50"
       operator = "gt",
       threshold = 50,
     },

     -- This script is only for alerts generation
     is_alert = true,

     -- See below
     hooks = {},

     gui = {
       i18n_title = "entity_thresholds.flow_attacker_title",
       i18n_description = "entity_thresholds.flow_attacker_description",
       i18n_field_unit = user_scripts.field_units.flow_sec,
       input_builder = "threshold_cross",
       field_max = 65535,
       field_min = 1,
       field_operator = "gt";
     }
   }

   -- #################################################################

   function script.hooks.min(params)
     local ff = host.getFlowFlood()
     local value = ff["hits.flow_flood_attacker"] or 0

     -- Check if the configured threshold is crossed by the value and possibly trigger an alert
     alerts_api.checkThresholdAlert(params, alert_consts.alert_types.alert_flows_flood, value)
   end

   -- #################################################################

   return script

The first thing to observe is that the script has only one function
with a predefined name :code:`script.hooks.min` which is part of the :ref:`User Script Hooks` table. This name tells
ntopng to call this function on every host, *every minute*. The body
of the function is fairly straightforward. It access a Lua table
:code:`host`, with several methods available to be called. This Lua
table contains references and methods that can be called on every host
of the system. As the aim of this plugin is to determine whether the
host is a flow flooder, method :code:`host.getFlowFlood()` is called
which contains flooding information. Then, a :code:`value` is read
from key :code:`hits.flow_flood_attacker` of the returned
table.

At this point, checking whether to trigger an alert or not, depending on
whether the :code:`value` is above the predefined threshold, is up to
the ntopng engine. From the perspective of this script, it suffices to
call method :code:`alerts_api.checkThresholdAlert`. The method takes
as input some params which falls outside the scope of this example,
along with the type of alert that needs to be generated, and the
actual :code:`value`. That is pretty much all. The ntopng engine will
evaluate :code:`value` and possibly trigger the alert.

Let's now have a closer look at the :code:`local script` table, which
basically contains all the necessary configuration, default values, and
information to properly render a configuration page on the :ref:`Web GUI`.

The table tells ntopng this script is enabled by default
(:code:`default_enabled = true`) and also specify the default
threshold values that should be used when no configuration has been
input from the web GUI (:code:`default_value`).

Then, a boolean flag
:code:`is_alert = true` is used to indicate the purpose of this user
script is to generate alerts.

An empty :code:`hooks` table is then
specified. This table is used by ntopng to determine when a certain
user script needs do be called. Remember the function
:code:`script.hooks.min`? That actually adds the entry :code:`min` to
the :code:`hooks` table so this plugin will be executed every minute!

Finally, there is a :code:`gui` table to give ntopng instructions on
how to render the configuration page of this user script. Basically, a
title, description and unit of measure are indicated, along with an
input builder and upper and lower bounds for the input. Input
builders, as it will be seen in the next section, are used by ntopng
to render the configuration of the user script.

Log Network Traffic
-------------------

This example shows how to log the traffic of a `local network`_.

.. code:: bash

	  network_monitor/
	      |-- manifest.lua
	      `-- user_scripts
		  `-- network
		      `-- traffic_log.lua

The main structure is very similar to the `Flow Flooders` example above
so it won't be discussed again. The core logic is contained into the
`traffic_log.lua` script which can be seen below:

.. code:: lua

   local user_scripts = require("user_scripts")
   require("lua_utils")

   local script = {
     -- This is a network related script
     category = user_scripts.script_categories.network,

     -- This module is enabled by default
     default_enabled = true,

     -- No configuration needed
     default_value = {},

     -- Hooks are defined below
     hooks = {},

     -- No GUI defined
     gui = {},
   }

   -- #################################################################

   function script.hooks.min(info)
     print(string.format("[%s]: in=%u, out=%u, inner=%u",
       info.entity_info.network_key,
       bytesToSize(info.entity_info.ingress),
       bytesToSize(info.entity_info.egress),
       bytesToSize(info.entity_info.inner),
     ))
   end

   -- #################################################################

   return(user_scripts)

The `script.hooks.min` hook is called by ntopng every minute for every
local network. It prints into the console the local network CIDR along
with the ingress, egress and inner traffic since startup.

All the network information is contained into the `info`
parameter. The most relevant fields are:

- :code:`granularity`: how often this script is called (60 for this example)
- :code:`alert_entity`: the alert entity, can be passed to the alerts API
  to trigger alerts
- :code:`entity_info`: information about the network, see below for details
- :code:`user_script_config`: the current configuration of this user script

The current network status is available into the `info.entity_info` field.
Here are reported the most important fields:

.. code::

   network_key string fe80::3252:cbff:fe6c:9c1b/64
   inner number 0
   broadcast table
   broadcast.inner number 0
   broadcast.egress number 0
   broadcast.ingress number 0
   egress number 19661
   num_hosts number 5
   ingress number 0
   throughput_bps number 35.692886352539
   engaged_alerts number 0

In particular:

- :code:`network_key`: the local network CIDR
- :code:`inner`: inner traffic value of the network since startup
- :code:`ingress`: ingress traffic value of the network since startup
- :code:`egress`: egress traffic value of the network since startup
- :code:`broadcast`: a table which contains `inner`, `egress` and `ingress`
  counters values for the broadcast traffic
- :code:`num_hosts`: number of active hosts of the network
- :code:`throughput_bps`: the current cumulative througput of the traffic
  of the network.
- :code:`engaged_alerts`: the currently engaged alerts of the network

A straightforward modification to the above script is to retrieve the
last minute ingress/egress/inner bytes instead of the startup values.
This can be easily accomplished by using the `network_delta_val` function:

.. code:: lua

   local egress_delta_bytes = alerts_api.network_delta_val("egress_delta", info.granularity, info.entity_info.egress)

The `egress_delta` identifier is a unique key that ntopng uses to hold the
values in subsequent calls to the function. The current network id is automatically
retrieved by ntopng. The granularity parameter is needed to differentiate between different
granularities. The last parameter, `info.entity_info.egress`, specifies the current value.
ntopng calculates the delta between this value and the previous one, which is stored into
the `egress_delta_bytes` variable.

SNMP Topology Changed
---------------------

The full plugin source is available at the `GitHub SNMP topology change page
<https://github.com/ntop/ntopng/tree/dev/scripts/plugins/snmp_topology_change>`_.
The script requires the ntopng Enterprise M license in order to be run.

The complete structure of the plugin is as follows:

.. code:: bash

	  snmp_topology_change/
	      |-- manifest.lua
	      |-- alert_definitions
	      |	  `-- alert_snmp_topology_changed.lua
	      `-- user_scripts
		  `-- snmp_device
		      `-- lldp_topology_changed.lua

This plugin uses the `LLDP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_Layer_Discovery_Protocol>`_
information that ntopng has collected to determine changes in the SNMP network topology.
When a new link is added or an old link is removed, the `alert_snmp_topology_changed` alert is generated.

Here is an analysis of the user script reponsible for the alert generation.

.. code:: lua

   local script = {
      category = user_scripts.script_categories.network,

      hooks = {},

      default_enabled = false,

      gui = {
	 i18n_title = "snmp.lldp_topology_changed_title",
	 i18n_description = "snmp.lldp_topology_changed_description",
      },
   }

   -- #################################################################

   function script.setup()
      return(ntop.isEnterpriseM())
   end

   -- #################################################################

   local function storeTopologyChangedAlert(info, arc, nodes, subtype)
      local parts = split(arc, "@")

      if(#parts == 2) then
	 alerts_api.store(
	    info.alert_entity, {
	       alert_type = alert_consts.alert_types.alert_snmp_topology_changed,
	       alert_subtype = subtype,
	       alert_severity = alert_consts.alert_severities.warning,
	       alert_granularity = info.granularity,
	       alert_type_params = {
		  node1 = parts[1], ip1 = nodes[parts[1]],
		  node2 = parts[2], ip2 = nodes[parts[2]],
	       },
	 })
      end
   end

   -- #################################################################

   function script.hooks.snmpDevice(device_ip, info)
      local arcs_key = "ntopng.cache.snmp_topology_arcs_monitor." .. device_ip
      local old_arcs = ntop.getPref(arcs_key)

      if not isEmptyString(old_arcs) then
	 old_arcs = json.decode(old_arcs) or {}
      else
	 old_arcs = {}
      end

      local nodes, arcs = snmp_utils.snmp_load_devices_topology(device_ip)
      local is_first_run = table.empty(old_arcs)
      local new_arcs = {}

      for arc in pairs(arcs) do
	 if(not is_first_run) then
	    if(not old_arcs[arc]) then
	       storeTopologyChangedAlert(info, arc, nodes, "arc_added")
	    else
	       old_arcs[arc] = nil
	    end
	 end

	 new_arcs[arc] = true
      end

      for arc in pairs(old_arcs) do
	 storeTopologyChangedAlert(info, arc, nodes, "arc_removed")
      end

      ntop.setPref(arcs_key, json.encode(new_arcs))
   end

   -- ################################################################

   return script

Here is a description of the general structure:

- :code:`script.category` the category for this script is `network`
- :code:`script.default_enabled` the script is disabled by default
- :code:`script.gui` defines the essential metadata, necessary to print the configuration into the GUI
- :code:`script.setup`: this returns false if the Enterprise M edition is not available, disabling the script
- :code:`script.hooks.snmpDevice`: defines the hook to be called after ntopng has processed a specific SNMP device.
  The `device_ip` contains the IP address of the SNMP device, whereas the `info` field contains some computed information
  on the device (use `tprint(info)` to get a list of fields). See below for a detailed description of this example.
- :code:`storeTopologyChangedAlert`: this function is responsible for the alert triggering part.

The `script.hooks.snmpDevice` function uses the `snmp_utils.snmp_load_devices_topology` function to retrieve the
latest LLDP information for the current SNMP device. The function returns a list of nodes and arcs involved
in this particular SNMP device topology. The `nodes` are Lua tables which maps `node_name` -> `node_ip`, for example:

.. code:: lua

    table
   AccessSW-1 string 172.16.24.1
   NetworkSpine-2 string 172.16.23.1

The `arcs` are Lua tables which contains links information between the SNMP device and other devices. Here is an example:

.. code:: lua

    table
   AccessSW-1@NetworkSpine-2 table
   AccessSW-1@NetworkSpine-2.1 number 25151496709
   AccessSW-1@NetworkSpine-2.2 string 2111493

The above information can be interpreted as:

- Exists a link between `AccessSW-1` and `NetworkSpine-2`
- `AccessSW-1` is connected to `NetworkSpine-2` via the interface with index `2111493`
- The total traffic registered from `AccessSW-1` to `NetworkSpine-2` is 25151496709 bytes

The user script keeps track of the old arcs by storing them into the Redis key `ntopng.cache.snmp_topology_arcs_monitor.<device_ip>`.
By comparing the old registered arcs with the new ones it can determine if an arc was removed or added.
