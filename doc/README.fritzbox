Analyzing Network Traffic with Fritz!Box
========================================

Capturing traffic via Router UI
-------------------------------

Owner of Fritz!Box routers can capture traffic accessing the URL
http://<ROUTER IP>/html/capture.html that is typically
http://fritz.box/html/capture.html

Inside the page you can dump traffic in pcap format for later analysis.


Live monitoring of router traffic
---------------------------------
If instead you want to monitor traffic in realtime with ntopng you can
do that easily using the script `ntopng/tools/fritzdump.sh`

Example usage:
```
ntopng/tools/fritzdump.sh <username> <password>
```

*NOTE:* If you use password-only authentification pass "dslf-config" as username

As you can see in the script, it will connect to the Fritz!Box via http://fritz.box,
authenticate with the user and password you passed and capture the traffic on the
WWAN interface and send ntopng via the stdout all the incoming traffic.
Modify the script to adapt it in case you have different setups.

Thanks to this solution you can use ntopng to monitor in realtime all the
traffic that is flowing inside your Fritz!Box router
