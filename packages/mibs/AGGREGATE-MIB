   AggrMOErrorStatus ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     STATUS       current
     DESCRIPTION
       "This data type is used to model the error status of the
        constituent MO instances.  The error status for a
        constituent MO instance is given in terms of two elements:
          o The moIndex, which indicates the position of the MO
            instance (starting at 1) in the value of the aggregated
            MO instance.
          o The moError, which indicates the error that was
            encountered in fetching that MO instance.
        The syntax in ASN.1 Notation will be
        ErrorStatus :: = SEQUENCE {
           moIndex  Integer32,
           moError  SnmpPduErrorStatus
        }
        AggrMOErrorStatus ::= SEQUENCE OF {
           ErrorStatus
        }
        Note1: The command responder will supply values for all
               constituent MO instances, in the same order in
               which the MO instances are specified for the AgMO.
               If an error is encountered for an MO instance, then
               the corresponding value will have an ASN.1 value NULL,
               and an error will be flagged in the corresponding
               AggrMOErrorStatus object.
               Only MOs for which errors have been encountered will
               have their corresponding moIndex and moError values
               set.
        Note2: The error code for the component MO instances will be
               in accordance with the SnmpPduErrorStatus TC defined
               in the DISMAN-SCHEDULE-MIB [RFC3231].
        Note3: The command generator will need to know
               constituent MO instances and their order to correctly
               interpret AggrMOErrorStatus.
