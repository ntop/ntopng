      DESCRIPTION
          "The MIB module defines management objects that model
          applications as collections of executables and files
          installed and executing on a host system.  The MIB
          presents a system-level view of applications; i.e.,
          objects in this MIB are limited to those attributes
          that can typically be obtained from the system itself
          without adding special instrumentation to the applications."

  -- sysApplElmtPastRunTable
  -- The sysApplElmtPastRunTable maintains a history of
  -- processes which have previously executed on

  -- of a process, the entry representing the process is removed from
  -- the sysApplElmtRunTable and a corresponding entry is created in
  -- this table provided that the process was part of an
  -- identifiable application.  If the process could not be associated

  -- with an invoked application, no corresponding entry is created.
  -- Hence, whereas the sysApplElmtRunTable contains an entry for
  -- every process currently executing on the system, the
  -- sysApplElmtPastRunTable only contains entries for processes
  -- that previously executed as part of an invoked application.
  --
  -- Entries remain in this table until they are aged out when
  -- either the number of entries in the table reaches a
  -- maximum as determined by sysApplElmtPastRunMaxRows, or
  -- when an entry has aged to exceed a time limit as set by
  -- sysApplElmtPastRunTblTimeLimit.  When aging out entries,
  -- the oldest entry, as determined by the value of
  -- sysApplElmtPastRunTimeEnded, will be removed first.
  --
  -- The table is indexed by sysApplInstallPkgIndex (from the
  -- sysApplInstallPkgTable), sysApplElmtPastRunInvocID, and
  -- sysApplElmtPastRunIndex to make it easy to locate all
  -- previously executed processes of a particular invoked application

          is a part.

          If, however, the 'parent' application cannot be
          determined, (for example the process is not part
          of a particular installed application), the value
          for this object is then '0', signifying that this
          process cannot be related back to an application,
          and in turn, an installed software package."
