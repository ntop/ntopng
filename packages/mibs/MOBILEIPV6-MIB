               "A global address for a home agent in the Home Agents
                List.
                The instances of the columnar objects in this entry
                pertain to an interface for a particular value of
                mip6HaLinkLocalAddressType, mip6HaLinkLocalAddress
                and mip6HaGaAddrSeqNo.
                The mip6HaGaAddrSeqNo object is used to distinguish
                between multiple instances of the home agent global
                addresses on the same interface for the same set of
                mip6HaLinkLocalAddressType, mip6HaLinkLocalAddress,
                values.
                There is no upper-bound on the maximum number of
                global addresses on an interface but, for practical
                purposes, the upper-bound of the value
                mip6HaGaAddrSeqNo is set to 1024.
                The interface is uniquely identified by its
                ipv6InterfaceIfIndex.  The same ipv6InterfaceIfIndex
                object is used in conjunction with the
                mip6HaLinkLocalAddressType, mip6HaLinkLocalAddress,
                and mip6HaGaAddrSeqNo to uniquely identify instances
                of the columnar objects of this row.

                Implementors need to be aware that if the total
                number of octets in mip6HaLinkLocalAddress
                exceeds 111, then OIDs of column instances in
                this row will have more than 128 sub-identifiers and
