ntopng is the next generation version of the original ntop, a network
traffic probe that shows the network usage, similar to what the
popular top Unix command does. ntopng is based on libpcap and it has
been written in a portable way in order to virtually run on every Unix
platform, MacOSX and on Windows as well.

ntopng users can use a a web browser to navigate through ntop (that
acts as a web server) traffic information and get a dump of the
network status. In the latter case, ntopng can be seen as a simple
RMON-like agent with an embedded web interface
